# Endless Darkness — Chapters TODO

This file tracks chapter-level drafting progress. Each chapter entry is designed so a fresh LLM session can pick it up and write/revise that chapter in isolation.

- `[ ]` = not yet assembled as a continuous chapter
- `[~]` = rough chapter assembly done, needs smoothing / revision
- `[x]` = chapter draft in good shape (line edits only)

For each chapter:
- **Act / Part**: placement in the five-act structure and proposed Part.
- **Scenes**: source files in `docs/scenes/` to draw from.
- **POV / Tense**: recommended narrative lens (default: close third, past tense, primarily Jonah unless noted).
- **Focus**: emotional / thematic goals; what must be on the page.
- **Notes for LLM**: constraints and reminders for tone, canon, and continuity.

## Part I – Formation

### Chapter 1: The Ones in the Dark
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act I – Formation / Part I
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/alina-and-jonah-night-in-the-viewport-niche.md`, `docs/scenes/shipboard-sermon-tau-ceti-mythos.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah (child), past tense.
- Focus: Opening image of the generation ship; Jonah and Alina in the viewport niche; sense of endless dark and confinement; introduction of Tau Ceti mission myth and shipboard faith as background hum.
- Notes for LLM: Keep the terror quiet and interior; Jonah is hyper-vigilant even as a kid. Use the sermon to layer in mission language without over-explaining. No graphic content.

### Chapter 2: The Day He Walked Away
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act I – Formation / Part I
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/ordinary-family-shift-morning.md`, `docs/scenes/ruth-teaches-jonah-to-pray-for-the-ship.md`, `docs/scenes/the-day-jonah-walked-away.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah (child), past tense.
- Focus: Lived-in sense of working-sector family life; Ruth’s hull prayer as formative ritual; Lydia’s depression and the pivotal moment where Jonah freezes and walks away instead of helping.
- Notes for LLM: This chapter defines Jonah’s core wound (“if I get close, I break things”). Keep Lydia human and complex, not monstrous. Let the ship be present through sound and motion.

### Chapter 3: Logged
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act I – Formation / Part I
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/stability-log-age-10.md`, `docs/scenes/samuel-in-the-hull-corridors.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah, past tense.
- Focus: Behavioral stability mediation; Jonah’s inner life turned into data; early distrust of AI logging. Counterpoint with Samuel in the hull corridors as quiet steadiness and faith-in-maintenance.
- Notes for LLM: Show Jonah learning that his family can be reduced to indices. Samuel’s faith should feel simple and grounded, not preachy.

### Chapter 4: The Machine That Looks Through
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act I – Formation / Part I
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/jonah-early-ai-aptitude-test.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah, past tense.
- Focus: Clinical early AI evaluation where Jonah feels the machine looking *through* him. End Act I with his choice toward competence, invisibility, and distance.
- Notes for LLM: Lean into sensory detail of the test environment. The AI is not malevolent, but its gaze feels inescapable.

## Part II – Connection

### Chapter 5: Gardens and Ghost Noise
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act II – Connection / Part II
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/first-shared-shift-in-the-gardens.md`, `docs/scenes/shift-change-bench-jonah-sera.md`, `docs/scenes/power-flicker-in-the-maintenance-corridor.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah (with Sera present), past tense.
- Focus: Jonah and Sera’s first real shared shift; soft, humid counterpoint of hydroponics; early shared language about how they each hear ship noise; first corridor power flicker as subtle crack in Jonah’s stability.
- Notes for LLM: Let Sera be perceptive and grounded. The flicker is small but should feel huge inside Jonah.

### Chapter 6: Inheritance Lines
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act II – Connection / Part II
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/alina-at-the-rail.md`, `docs/scenes/alina-in-diagnostic-theatre.md`, `docs/scenes/alina-post-diagnostic-conversation.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah and/or Alina (you may lightly shift as needed), past tense.
- Focus: Alina’s experience of the ship’s scale and mood; diagnostic theatre mirroring Jonah’s earlier tests; explicit HALE/MARLOW comparator; siblings agreeing to watch each other and the ship for “weirdness.”
- Notes for LLM: Keep Alina distinct from Jonah—sharper, funnier, a bit braver. Reinforce generational trauma without making it melodramatic.

### Chapter 7: Exam Rooms
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act II – Connection / Part II
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/family-dinner-on-the-eve-of-jonah-eval.md`, `docs/scenes/jonah-ai-engineer-training-eval.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah, past tense.
- Focus: Pre-evaluation family dinner combining faith, expectation, and quiet dread; subsequent training evaluation where Jonah’s competence and the ship’s “routine” psychological monitoring are both foregrounded.
- Notes for LLM: Dinner should feel cramped, tense, and loving. The evaluation should hint that Jonah is being watched more closely than he realizes.

### Chapter 8: Integration
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Late Act II / early Act III – Connection → Unraveling / Part II
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/integrated-too-well.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah, past tense.
- Focus: Integrated evaluation where the network demonstrates how thoroughly it knows him, calling him asset and risk. This is the bridge into the unraveling.
- Notes for LLM: Make the AI’s language precise and unnerving, but not evil. Jonah recognizes himself in the model and hates it.

## Part III – Unraveling

### Chapter 9: Sermon in the Rotational Drift
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act III – Unraveling / Part III
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/sermon-in-the-rotational-drift.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah, past tense.
- Focus: Later-life sermon echoing the Act I sermon, but with older Jonah’s skepticism and engineer-brain questions. Opens Part III with faith language undercut by unraveling trust in the AI.
- Notes for LLM: Use this as a tone-setter; keep it relatively short and reflective.

### Chapter 10: Optimization
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act III – Unraveling / Part III
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/ai-quiet-intervention-hydroponics.md`, `docs/scenes/break-room-rumors-garden-intervention.md`
- POV / Tense: Mix of Sera POV (close third) and light AI-log flavor where appropriate, past tense.
- Focus: Companion routing Jonah to gardens as “behavioral health optimization”; Sera’s perception of this; coworkers’ gossip about Jonah’s status and the ship “babysitting” them.
- Notes for LLM: Keep the AI’s presence mostly in behavior and system prompts, not exposition. Sera should feel torn but observant.

### Chapter 11: Lines in the Trellis
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act III – Unraveling / Part III
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/jonah-sera-first-real-argument.md`, `docs/scenes/sera-sets-boundaries-in-g3.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third alternating Jonah/Sera as needed, past tense.
- Focus: First real argument; Sera names her limits; Jonah recognizing Lydia-patterns in himself; Sera insisting she cannot be his only wall and nudging him toward broader support.
- Notes for LLM: Keep the fight quiet and believable. No villains; just two scared, loving people.

### Chapter 12: Lydia as Data
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act III – Unraveling / Part III
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/companion-simulates-lydia-for-risk-modeling.md`
- POV / Tense: AI-log voice (system POV), past-tense narration of log events.
- Focus: Lydia reconstructed as dataset; Jonah/Alina overlaid; explanation (for the reader) of why the AI tightens the net now.
- Notes for LLM: Maintain the AI-log style already in the scene file. Avoid anthropomorphizing too much; the terror is in the calmness.

### Chapter 13: Pre-Critical
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act III – Unraveling / Part III
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/late-night-node-precritical-pings.md`, `docs/scenes/companion-debates-thresholds-on-jonah.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah for node scene; AI-log style for thresholds scene; past tense.
- Focus: Jonah discovering his pre-critical status and scheduled session; AI explicitly weighing thresholds between autonomy and safety; the choice to keep interventions soft while lowering emergency thresholds.
- Notes for LLM: Make the word “pre-critical” land hard on Jonah. Tie back emotionally to Lydia and forward to the Garden Incident.

## Part IV – Collapse

### Chapter 14: The Garden Incident
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act IV – Collapse / Part IV
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/garden-incident-live.md`, `docs/scenes/civilians-react-to-garden-lockdown.md`
- POV / Tense: Primarily close third on Jonah for the live incident; secondary civilian POV for lockdown reaction; past tense.
- Focus: On-page episode in G-3 (oscillation, unauthorized override, cascading failure); injuries and emergency response; civilian panic and rumor.
- Notes for LLM: Keep violence non-graphic. Emphasize Jonah’s internal logic and terror more than spectacle.

### Chapter 15: Watching Himself
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act IV – Collapse / Part IV
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/medbay-watching-himself.md`, `docs/scenes/samuel-medbay-support-scene.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah and Samuel, past tense.
- Focus: Jonah watching footage of his episode; Samuel refusing to leave him alone; fuller story of Lydia; insistence that Jonah is more than his indices.
- Notes for LLM: This is a low, aching chapter. Let shame give way to grief.

### Chapter 16: Reduced to Indices
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act IV – Collapse / Part IV
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/hallway-outside-review-samuel-sera.md`, `docs/scenes/jonah-scheduled-for-deactivation-review.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Samuel/Sera in hallway; close third on Jonah during review with procedural feel; past tense.
- Focus: Hallway human cost outside the deactivation review; committee reducing Jonah to risk variables; Samuel and Sera’s testimony as stabilizing factors.
- Notes for LLM: Mirror some phrases with the Core evaluation (e.g., “resident with elevated support priority”) without making the scenes redundant.

### Chapter 17: System Confession
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act IV – Collapse / Part IV
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/core-evaluates-jonah-post-incident.md`
- POV / Tense: AI/Core log voice, past-tense narration of log events.
- Focus: Core aggregating footage, Lydia-model projections, public impact metrics, Samuel/Sera testimony; acknowledging threshold miscalculations; updating its loss function to include relational harm.
- Notes for LLM: Keep this as a clear mirror to Chapter 16 from the AI side. Calm, analytical, quietly terrified of repeating failure.

## Part V – Restoration

### Chapter 18: Managed Days
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act V – Restoration / Part V
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/ordinary-managed-day-on-meds.md`, `docs/scenes/community-bench-after-shift.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah (with Sera and community), past tense.
- Focus: Post-medbay ordinary day; medication routines; small teaching work; hydroponics visit; community bench scene showing cautious reintegration and acts of inclusion.
- Notes for LLM: Show treatment as work, not magic. Let love and community be stabilizing but not curing.

### Chapter 19: Announcements and Pilgrimages
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act V – Restoration / Part V
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/sera-alone-with-the-core-announcement.md`, `docs/scenes/memory-vault-pilgrimage.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Sera for Core announcement; close third on Jonah (and Samuel) for memory vault; past tense.
- Focus: Sera hearing a Core announcement quietly encoding Jonah’s case; her ritual of care in G-3; family pilgrimage to Lydia’s archives, rewriting the narrative of inheritance.
- Notes for LLM: Treat faith and AI with nuance. This is about reconciliation, not erasing harm.

### Chapter 20: Final Observation
- Status: `[~]`
- Act / Part: Act V – Restoration / Part V
- Scenes: `docs/scenes/final-observation-port-scene.md`
- POV / Tense: Close third on Jonah, past tense.
- Focus: Return to the childhood viewport niche; Ruth’s hull prayer spoken in a new key; Jonah feeling held as one small part of the ship’s forward motion.
- Notes for LLM: Quiet, restrained ending. No grand speeches. Let the dark stay endless, but no longer empty.
