Endless Darkness is a character-driven science fiction novel set aboard a massive generation ship carrying millions of people across interstellar space. The story follows Jonah Hale, a quiet and brilliant young man shaped by generational trauma, untreated mental illness in his family, and a lifetime spent hiding his own storms. It is a narrative about fear, love, faith, recovery, and the search for a place to rest.

This repository contains the full structure of the novel, including chapters, worldbuilding documents, character profiles, thematic notes, outlines, and research materials. It is designed for clarity, iteration, and long-term development.

## Core Premise

Roughly 22,000 years ago, humanity discovered a rogue ice giant on a collision course with Earth. With about 2,000 years to prepare, the world united to build thousands of enormous generation ships and, roughly 20,000 years ago, launched them toward distant stars. The journey itself is a 40,000-year mission, now halfway complete. Across the millennia since launch, communication with Earth and the other ships has long been lost. For Jonah, the ship is all he has ever known. It is his world.

Jonah’s life begins to shift when he falls in love with Sera Solano, a woman who sees him clearly and does not turn away. As Jonah tries to hold his life together, the unresolved storms inside him begin to break open. The ship’s AI notices. Jonah’s family notices. Jonah himself cannot avoid the truth.

Endless Darkness follows Jonah through formation, connection, unraveling, collapse, and restoration as he learns what it means to seek help, to accept love, and to build a home within himself.

## Goals

Endless Darkness aims to combine hard science fiction with an intimate emotional core. The story is personal, grounded, and honest. It uses the scale of a generation ship to highlight the inner world of a single life and the people who shape it.

The novel explores mental illness with seriousness and respect, drawing on real experience and hard emotional truths. It aims to show that healing is possible, love is real, and home can be built even in endless darkness.

## Status

In active development. Chapters and structure will evolve as the manuscript grows.
