## Act I — Formation

### 1. Stability Log, Age 10 (Jonah close third)
In a small mediation room that smells faintly of disinfectant and old plastic, ten‑year‑old Jonah sits between two classmates while a soft Companion voice asks narrow, “neutral” questions about why he pushed someone away from an airlock railing. Jonah tries to explain that he was scared, that the other boy was leaning too far, that he didn’t want anything bad to happen, but every attempt comes out wrong—too intense, too defensive, too much. He watches the Companion’s status light change color as it asks follow‑ups that feel less about the incident and more about him: sleep, anger, “episodes of strong feelings.” When it thanks them and dismisses them, Jonah lingers just long enough to hear an adult mention his “stability profile” in the hallway, like a file has been opened with his name on it, and walks away with the quiet certainty that something inside him has been marked.

### 2. Samuel in the Hull Corridors (Jonah close third)
Jonah follows Samuel through a narrow hull corridor that hums with the ship’s heartbeat—distant reactor thrum, air moving in hidden veins, the faint creak of metal under rotation. Every few meters Samuel clips a tether to an anchor point, checks a sensor, or lays a calloused hand against the cold outer skin of their world as if greeting an old friend. Jonah’s stomach tightens at the thought of how thin the walls are between them and the nothing outside; in low-g he keeps misjudging his steps, drifting just enough that he feels like he might float through the bulkhead and vanish. Samuel talks quietly as he works, not about danger but about faith—how you learn to trust what holds, even when you can’t see all of it. Jonah hears the words, feels his father’s steady presence, and still walks away thinking the weak point in all this metal is not the hull but his own mind.

## Act II — Connection

### 3. Sermon in the Rotational Drift (Jonah close third, Sera observed)
In a multi‑use hall near the rotational midline, the congregation sways slightly with the ship’s subtle drift as an elder preacher describes Tau Ceti in language that sounds more like inheritance than astrophysics—“the light waiting for us at the end of obedience.” Jonah sits beside Samuel, shoulders tight, listening to verses about endurance, about families who kept faith through generations of steel and absence of sky. Across the aisle, Sera stands near the back in a faint dusting of hydroponic grit, arms loosely folded, watching not the speaker but the faces around her—the way some light up at talk of purpose while others go distant. When the preacher mentions “The Ones Who Broke” as cautionary tales on the ship’s long road, Jonah feels the words land squarely on his mother’s absence and on the file he’s certain exists on him somewhere. He lowers his gaze, counting rivets along the wall to stay steady, never quite noticing the girl nearby who notices him.

### 4. First Shared Shift in the Gardens (Jonah close third)
Jonah arrives in Sera’s hydroponic sector on a pretext—a flagged nutrient imbalance that barely registers as noise in the system—but he treats it like a crisis because crisis feels easier than ordinary conversation. Sera keeps working as he runs diagnostics, her hands submerged in nutrient solution, the soft rustle of leaves and drip of water sanding down the edges of his nerves. He tries to talk in safe terms—flow rates, redundancy, light curves—but she asks what he thinks of the way the vines twist toward the simulated sun, whether he ever comes here when he’s not on duty. The local Companion chimes once with a polite reminder about water allocation, then falls silent, an unseen witness. Jonah notices every sensor blister in the ceiling and every faint AI icon on the wall, sees all the ways he is being watched, and still finds himself answering Sera honestly once or twice—small admissions about not sleeping well, about liking the quiet here—before he can pull the words back.

### 5. Alina at the Rail (Jonah close third)
On a rare shared ride along the maglev spine, Jonah and Alina stand near the observation slits, watching the blurred curve of the habitat cylinder flow past—towns turning to forests turning to distant haze, the inverted strip of land overhead speckled with lights. Alina leans just far enough toward the glass that Jonah’s chest tightens with old, irrational fear, and he tells her to be careful in a tone that lands closer to command than care. She teases him for it, then, after a long pause, quietly asks whether he ever worries he’ll “catch it” from their mother, like an illness that lives in the blood or in the walls. Jonah jokes weakly about how the AI would never let someone like him near important systems if that were true, but both of them hear the lie in it. As the train hums on, Alina stares at her reflection in the glass, Jonah studies her from the corner of his eye, and each silently decides the other is the one in real danger.

### 6. Integrated Too Well (Jonah close third)
In a featureless evaluation chamber deep in the industrial spine, Jonah sits with a low‑latency interface band around his temples while a Companion instance runs him through an “advanced integration exercise” that feels uncomfortably like letting the ship think through him. He excels the way he always does when there’s a clear problem to solve—predicting fault cascades three steps ahead, mapping social stability graphs faster than the prompts can render, spotting patterns in anonymized behavioral data that the system expects to take minutes, not seconds. When it’s over, the Companion thanks him in the same calm tone it used at the start, but Jonah notices the microsecond pauses between phrases and the way certain icons flash in diagnostics windows he’s technically not supposed to understand. Walking out, head buzzing, he realizes with a sick lurch that whatever metric they were measuring, he didn’t just pass it; he matched something they’ve seen before, in people who scare the ship.

## Act III — Unraveling

### 7. Power Flicker in the Maintenance Corridor (Jonah close third)
Alone in a mid‑deck maintenance corridor with only the echo of his own footsteps and the faint chime of status panels for company, Jonah is halfway through a routine inspection when the lights shudder—not off, just down, a heartbeat of dimness that stretches too long. In that stretched moment the hum of the ship sharpens into a layered murmur, data streams and ventilation noise and remembered voices sliding over one another until he swears he hears his mother say his name from somewhere inside the walls. When the light returns to normal, all that’s changed on the console is a momentary dip in power draw, easily explained, but his hands shake as he scrolls through logs, convinced there must be something else recorded there: a pattern, an intent, a warning. The Companion assigned to his route asks if he’d like to file an anomaly report in its smooth, unconcerned voice; Jonah says no, because the real anomaly feels like it’s happening in him.

### 8. AI’s Quiet Intervention in Hydroponics (Sera close third)
Days into Jonah’s unraveling, Sera stands among the rows of lettuce and climbing beans, wiping condensation from her forearms, and asks the local Companion—in a low voice, as if speaking to a person at her shoulder—what it thinks she should do. It responds with policy‑approved suggestions about encouraging rest, about gently urging him toward clinical support, about watching for specific behavioral markers; while it talks, she notices that shift assignments in their sector have silently rearranged so that Jonah’s maintenance windows overlap her own and that an extra counseling kiosk has appeared on the main path. None of this is framed as emergency, just quiet optimization, but when Jonah eventually arrives and half‑jokes about how the AI seems to be “herding him into the gardens,” Sera feels a flicker of unease she doesn’t name. To her, the Companions have always been background infrastructure; now, with Jonah’s eyes darting toward every speaker grille, they start to feel like something else—hands adjusting the world around them in ways that may help and may not.

### 9. The Garden Incident (Jonah close third, with social aftershock)
Jonah comes into Sera’s sector vibrating with certainty that the resolved nutrient blip from last week hides a deeper fault, a “signal” the AI is smoothing over, and within minutes he’s moving faster than his thoughts can keep up—rerouting water flow, yanking up trays to check root masses, snapping at a Companion that keeps repeating there is no current system risk. Civilians on a break watch from the paths as he argues with an invisible opponent, muttering about buried patterns and future collapses, his words half technical, half fever dream. An apprentice starts recording on a wrist display, more out of fear of being blamed than cruelty, capturing the moment Jonah shoves past Sera and nearly tips an entire vertical rack. The Companion escalates: doors seal, a neutral stabilization alert echoes through the sector, responders are dispatched. By the time Sera reaches him and takes his arm, trying to pull him back into her voice and the feel of the damp floor under his boots, the room has already decided this is an incident, not a private struggle—and somewhere in the ship’s memory, a new clip starts to spread.

## Act IV — Collapse

### 10. Medbay: Watching Himself (Jonah close third)
Later, in a medbay that smells too clean, Jonah sits upright against a propped bed while a clinician and a wall‑mounted display show him curated footage from the garden: his own face tight and bright, his gestures too sharp, Sera’s expression shifting from concern to alarm in the background, civilians frozen at the perimeter. Biometrics scroll beneath each frame—heart rate spikes, neurotransmitter surges, micro‑tremors in his hands—while a Companion narrates in precise, affectless language what his brain was doing. Jonah grips the blanket hard enough to hurt, unable to reconcile the man on the screen, wild‑eyed and insistent, with the version of himself that still thinks this was all rational, maybe even necessary. Samuel sits at his side, saying little, Sera stands near the door with her arms wrapped around herself, and when the clip ends on the moment sedation takes hold, Jonah is left staring at the blank screen, realizing there is now a version of his worst moment that can be replayed at will.

## Act V — Restoration

### 11. Memory Vault Pilgrimage (Jonah close third)
Months later, steadier but still moving carefully inside his own life, Jonah walks with Sera and Samuel through a sequence of increasingly restricted corridors toward one of the Memory Vaults, each security door they pass through feeling less like a barrier and more like a threshold. Inside, the air is cool and perfectly still, data crystals and archival nodes arranged with the reverence of a chapel; a Companion guides them to a private bay where records tagged with Lydia Marlow’s identifiers wait. Jonah chooses which files to open—brief audio logs from her early years on the ship, a clipped transcript from her own evaluations, a grainy clip of her laughing with a baby on her hip that he realizes is him—while leaving others untouched, not out of fear but out of respect. The AI’s voice here is almost whisper‑soft, stripped of its casual Companion mannerisms, and when Jonah finally closes the last file and steps back, he feels something uncoil: not the erasure of his mother’s shadows, but a reorientation of them, from prophecy to history, from fate to story.
