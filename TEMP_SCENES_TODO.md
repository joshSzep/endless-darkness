# TEMP SCENES TODO (Reverse Criticality)

Least critical at the top, most critical at the bottom. Each entry is a seed: enough shape to guide drafting, still loose enough to evolve.

---

## 1. [ ] Sermon in the Rotational Drift (low criticality, high flavor)
- A multi-use hall near the rotational midline hosts a drifting congregation listening to an elder preach about Tau Ceti as promise and inheritance.
- The talk blurs theology and mission-myth, invoking "The Ones Who Broke" as cautionary tales.
- Jonah sits beside Samuel, body tight, counting rivets to keep from floating into the rhetoric; across the aisle, Sera stands coated in the dust of her shift, watching people more than doctrine.
- Less about plot, more about showing how faith, mission, and stigma intertwine, and letting Jonah and Sera share air before they share words.

## 2. [ ] Alina at the Rail (flexible, deepens sibling trauma)
- On a maglev ride that cuts along the cylinder, Jonah and Alina stand by narrow viewports watching their world loop past and overhead.
- Starts as easy sibling banter—teasing about Jonah's caution, shared jokes about never seeing certain sectors.
- Slides into a blunt question from Alina about "catching" their mother's illness; Jonah’s deflection and her silence linger.
- Compact way to show generational fear bleeding sideways through the family.

## 3. [ ] AI's Quiet Intervention in Hydroponics (subtle AI/society tension)
- Sera, alone in the rows of green, asks the local Companion what to do about Jonah.
- The AI answers in gentle, protocol-shaped advice while rosters reconfigure and a counseling kiosk appears where none stood before.
- Later, Jonah notices how often he "happens" to be routed past the gardens and jokes about it, half amused, half unsettled.
- Lives in the dissonance between Sera's sense of the AI as infrastructure and Jonah's terror of being managed.

## 4. [ ] Integrated Too Well (AI arc intensifier, compressible if needed)
- In a stark evaluation chamber, Jonah undergoes a high-level integration exercise: reading anonymized behavioral data, modeling cascading failures, syncing with Companion logic over a neural band.
- He performs beyond expectations, anticipating outcomes faster than prompts load, seeing connections flagged as "historically atypical."
- The Companion stays polite, but tiny delays and diagnostic flashes betray that something in how the ship sees him has changed.
- Cleanest place to show why Jonah specifically terrifies the models—where brilliance and risk become statistically linked.

## 5. [ ] Stability Log, Age 10 (early brush with surveillance and stigma)
- A mediation room, three kids, and a Companion trained to sound reassuring as it asks its way past an incident toward a pattern.
- Young Jonah struggles to explain his protective instinct without sounding unstable; the AI dutifully records sleep trouble, strong feelings, family context.
- A snatch of adult conversation about his "stability profile" reveals this is about more than a single day.
- Plants the seed that his interior life can be captured, coded, and held against him.

## 6. [ ] Samuel in the Hull Corridors (father/void, atmospheric but important)
- Jonah follows Samuel through cramped hull corridors: tethers, anchor points, and constant awareness of the thin metal between them and the dark.
- Samuel moves with practiced ease, pausing to listen to the ship like a man listening for a beloved voice.
- As they work, Samuel talks about trust—of materials, people, God—letting Jonah overhear rather than be preached at.
- Leaves Jonah holding two truths at once: his father’s steadiness and his own fear that he is the part that might fail.

## 7. [ ] Power Flicker in the Maintenance Corridor (first clear crack in perception)
- On a routine solo route, a slight dimming of the lights stretches out of proportion, turning the corridor into a humming throat of metal and data.
- In that elongated heartbeat, ship-noise layers resolve into something that feels like his mother saying his name.
- Logs later show only a trivial power fluctuation; Jonah refuses to file an anomaly report, and the Companion blandly accepts this.
- Marks the moment where external ship-strain and his internal storm become indistinguishable, at least to him.

## 8. [ ] First Shared Shift in the Gardens (primary Jonah–Sera bonding)
- Jonah arrives in hydroponics under the guise of a minor nutrient blip and finds Sera wrist-deep in systems he usually sees as abstractions.
- Side-by-side interaction: she prunes and adjusts flow, asking pointed but non-threatening questions; he runs diagnostics and hides in technical commentary.
- The gardens feel like a separate climate—humid, breathing, watching—with the local Companion receding into the background.
- Jonah's small slips toward honesty and Sera's choice not to press establish their long-term dynamic.

## 9. [ ] The Day Jonah Walked Away (childhood pattern, emotional DNA)
- Seven-year-old Jonah finds Lydia sitting at the kitchen table, breathing but unreachable, and freezes in the "wrong" quiet of the apartment.
- The urge to help collides with a deeper, wordless terror that getting too close will break something in him forever.
- He backs away, hides in his room while Samuel discovers the scene, and never fully forgives himself.
- Becomes the invisible line under all his later choices—the proof that when it mattered most, he retreated.

## 10. [ ] Medbay: Watching Himself (shame, realization, turning toward help)
- In medbay, propped upright and medicated but newly clear, Jonah watches curated footage of the Garden Incident on a wall display.
- Clinical overlays track his biometrics while a Companion narrates his brain state as if he were a case study.
- Seeing himself—fast, bright, frightening—and seeing Sera and bystanders in that field of chaos forces a reckoning.
- Samuel’s quiet presence and Sera’s visible bracing make it clear he is loved and dangerous in the same body; this is where he stops believing he can manage alone.

## 11. [ ] Memory Vault Pilgrimage (forgiveness, theme thesis, endpoint)
- Months later, Jonah walks with Sera and Samuel into a Memory Vault that feels more like a temple than a server room.
- Guided by a Companion that drops most conversational affect, he chooses which of Lydia’s records to face and which to leave closed.
- The power is in both what he watches—a younger, trying Lydia—and what he leaves untouched, out of respect rather than fear.
- This is where generational trauma stops being prophecy and becomes history, with faith, AI memory, and human choice sharing the same quiet room.
