# Chapter 2: The Day He Walked Away

Morning came in panels, not sunrise.

The light over Jonah's bunk brightened by precise increments, cool white pushing back the soft gray of ship-night. It always started at his feet first, crawling up the bulkhead like someone opening a door very slowly. He lay still and watched it climb, counting the seconds between each little surge out of habit. The Companions called it "circadian ramp," as if a word like that could make it feel less like being measured.

On the bunk above, Alina had already peeled back her curtain. Her bare toes dangled over the edge, tracing invisible arcs in the air. She had pushed her light to "dawn" ten minutes early again, so her corner of the narrow cabin glowed warm while the rest still softened itself.

"You're going to blind yourself," Jonah muttered.

"I'm painting," she said.

He rolled onto his back to look up at her. The "painting" was a scrap of maintenance cloth she'd fixed to the underside of the bunk with sealant tabs. This week it was a smear of blues and rusts, streaked where the pigment hadn't dried before she pulled the curtain closed the night before. In the ramping light it looked like a slice of the river band he'd only seen on feeds.

"With what?" he asked. "We don't have any more—"

"Spare pigment from school," she said quickly. "They were going to wash it out anyway. I saved it. Recycling." She dangled one foot lower and nudged his shoulder. "Stop breathing like Ruth when she walks in on us playing with her beads. It's legal."

"Ruth's beads were blessed," Jonah said, but the complaint came out thin. He scrubbed his hands over his face. "And they were hers."

"This was for a poster about proper gray-water usage." Alina's toes flexed. "I think God can survive without that particular sermon."

The door-seam light in the main room brightened, the Companions' way of prodding the rest of the quarters toward wakefulness. Through the thin wall he heard the hiss of the galley tap and the clink of metal against ceramic.

Samuel was up.

Jonah swung his legs over the side of the bunk and dropped to the floor. The deck was cool under his bare feet, the faint vibration of the Ship humming up through his bones. He paused for half a heartbeat, letting the hum settle under his skin, listening for anything out of place. Same as always: low, steady, with a slightly higher tone that meant one of the maglev lines was running heavy somewhere above their sector.

He exhaled and reached for his work pants.

By the time he stepped into the main room, Samuel had two bowls on the narrow fold-out table and a third in his hand. He was still in his sleep shirt, but his workband was already buckled around his wrist, dark screen waiting for the morning's assignments. Steam curled from the pot on the galley unit; the smell of fortified grain porridge filled the small space, thin but warm.

"Morning," Samuel said.

"Morning." Jonah glanced at the wall clock without meaning to. It read 06:12 in small, merciless digits. His father's shift started at 07:00; the hull corridor was three lifts and two crossings away.

"You slept?" Samuel asked.

"Enough." Jonah lied automatically, then softened it. "Mostly."

Samuel's mouth hitched in a half-smile that didn't reach his eyes.

"Mostly's more than not at all," he said. "Sit. Eat."

The third bowl thunked onto the table as Alina shuffled in, rubbing at one eye with the heel of her palm. Her hair stuck out in lopsided twists where the sleep band had failed to keep it in place.

"You started without me," she complained.

"We waited for you," Samuel said. "The Ship didn't."

As if to illustrate the point, a Companion chime sounded from the wall panel, soft and unobtrusive. A neutral voice followed, speaking in the sector dialect that sat somewhere between formal Earth Standard and the clipped slang of the working bands.

"Working Ring C-3, morning hull integrity report available. No new critical breaches. Micro-impact log: two events, segments 14 and 19, both below threshold. Rotational variance within expected bounds. Please acknowledge if you are scheduled for external work between 07:00 and 19:00."

Samuel reached past Jonah to tap the panel, acknowledgment pinging back to whatever node was listening. The word "critical" sat in the air a little too long.

"See?" Alina said around a mouthful of porridge. "No new holes today. You can relax."

Samuel chuckled, a low sound.

"That's not how it works," he said. He picked up his spoon but didn't quite eat yet, gaze ticking to the ceiling as if he could see through bulkheads and support struts to the hull beyond. "No new critical breaches just means we haven't found the small ones yet."

"Comforting," Jonah muttered.

Samuel looked at him then, properly. His eyes were tired, but clear. There was always a residue of hull dust on him that no wash cycle could quite erase; Jonah thought of it as a second skin.

"It is comforting," Samuel said. "Because it means the Ship is telling us the truth. And it means I still have a job." He dipped his spoon, finally, and took a bite. "Eat. You'll need your head clear today for school."

"It's not just school," Jonah said. "We have the systems lab block. We're shadowing the Companion consoles." The words came out quicker than he'd intended, a small pulse of pride he couldn't quite hide.

Samuel's brows lifted.

"Console work," he repeated. "In C-3?"

"Just the training sim," Jonah said quickly. "Not real routing. We watch the calls, see how they balance load."

Alina perked up.

"Do you get to see the Command decks?" she asked. "The real ones, with the big displays?"

"Not from one lab," Jonah said. "Maybe later. If I do well."

Samuel's spoon hovered halfway to his mouth.

"You usually do," he said. The sentence carried no pressure, just fact, but Jonah heard the weight behind it anyway.

The panel chimed again, a gentle series this time. "Behavioral Stability appointments begin in forty-eight minutes. Please ensure minors are accompanied if scheduled." The same neutral tone, the same gently rounded syllables, but that phrase always rang sharper in Jonah's ears than any impact report.

He kept his gaze on his bowl.

"You're not scheduled today," Samuel said quietly. "That's Alina."

Alina made a face.

"It's just a check-in," she said. "They want to hear about my 'feelings about future vocational pathways'." She exaggerated the formal wording, making it ridiculous. "I told them I feel like not talking about it. They said that was a 'starting point'." She rolled her eyes.

"Ruth would say talking to them is like talking to a wall that writes things down," Samuel said.

"Ruth talks to walls all the time," Jonah said. "She blesses the lift before she gets in."

As if summoned, Ruth shuffled out from the sleeping alcove, wrapped in her worn robe, gray hair braided back. Her bare feet were silent on the deck, but the faint clack of her prayer beads against her wrist announced her as surely as any chime.

"Ruth talks to the One who hears through the wall," she corrected, not unkindly. "Morning, babies." She bent just enough to press a kiss to the top of Jonah's head, then Alina's shoulder. "Samuel."

"Ma," Samuel said. There was a quiet warmth in the word that Jonah never heard him use with anyone else.

Ruth brushed her fingers over the bulkhead by the table, the same patch of composite Samuel always checked as he left. Her lips moved, voice too low to catch the words, but Jonah knew the pattern: a thanks for holding, a plea to keep holding. She had taught it to him when he was small, his palm pressed against cold metal while she whispered about God and steel and faith as if they were all different faces of the same thing.

"You say it too," she told him now, catching his eye. "Even if it's just in here." She tapped his chest with two fingers. "Ship listens better when we do our part."

Jonah nodded, unsure whether she meant the AI or something beyond it. Maybe she didn't see a difference.

"I'll walk Alina to her appointment," Ruth said, reaching for a bowl. "Samuel, you finish eating. You look like a man about to go out on an empty tank."

"Yes, Ma," Samuel said, that half-smile again.

They fell into a familiar rhythm then: spoons scraping, the hiss of the galley as Ruth rinsed a stray cup, Alina humming some half-remembered melody under her breath as she swallowed faster than was wise. Jonah watched his family move around the small space and, for once, did not try to count all the places this morning could go wrong.

The hull report had said "no new critical breaches." The Behavioral Stability chime had not included his name. The Ship's hum under his feet was steady.

Maybe, he thought, as he finished his bowl and stood to clear it, this was what normal was supposed to feel like: frail and noisy and crowded, but whole.

Samuel rose too, setting his bowl aside. He checked his workband, thumb skimming the morning's assignments that had just populated the screen. Jonah saw the tiny crease appear between his brows as he read—a familiar micro-expression that meant there was more work than there were hands, that some segment's plate count had come up wrong in the night.

"Bad?" Jonah asked before he could stop himself.

Samuel glanced at him, then deliberately smoothed his expression.

"Busy," he said. "That's all." He reached for his outer jacket, pulling it on with practiced efficiency. "Come on. Walk me to the lift."

Jonah hesitated, then nodded. Alina groaned theatrically.

"You get to escort Papa," she said. "I get the Stabilizers."

"You get Ruth," Jonah said. "That's better."

Ruth snorted softly.

"We all get the Ship," she said. "And the Ship gets us. Best remember it goes both ways."

At the threshold, Samuel paused. The door panel light had shifted to a soft green, indicating corridor traffic was light. He laid his palm flat against the frame just as Ruth had against the wall.

"Keep us," he murmured. "We'll keep you."

Jonah's throat tightened at the simplicity of it. Before he could think better of it, he put his own hand beside his father's, fingers splayed over the metal. The bulkhead was cool and solid under his skin, hum steady.

He didn't say the words out loud. But he thought them, shaped them in the quiet space behind his ribs: Keep us. We'll keep you.

The panel chimed acknowledgment of their exit request. The door slid open on a corridor already alive with the low murmur of neighbors starting their own days. The same Ship, the same light, the same endless metal wrapped around them all.

Jonah stepped out with his father, ordinary morning settling over his shoulders like a familiar jacket.

Later, there would be drills.


---

The hull kept creaking long after the drill ended.

During the alarm, everything had been loud in the right way: siren pulse, calm instructions over the speakers, the soft thud of neighbors' feet as they moved to assigned spots. Jonah had stood between his father and his grandmother in the narrow corridor, feeling the vibration of the Ship's voice through the wall.

"This is a drill," the Companion had said. "There is no current loss of pressure. Please follow standard protocol."

Now the lights were back to normal. The siren was off. People had gone home. The official threat level on the wall display had dropped back to its usual calm green.

The hull had not gotten the message.

Jonah lay on the narrow bunk in the Hales' pod and watched the shadow of the vent grate on the ceiling. Every few heartbeats, a small metallic tick answered the Ship's breathing: thermal expansion, Samuel had called it. Metal relaxing after stress.

It sounded like something cracking.

He pulled the thin blanket higher even though he wasn't cold.

"You're supposed to be asleep, little bird," a voice said softly from the doorway.

Jonah turned his head.

Ruth stood in the rectangle of dim corridor light, one hand braced on the jamb. She'd wrapped her hair in a worn scarf for the night, the pattern faded from years of washing. Behind her, the pod was a stack of darker shadows: Samuel's bunk, the tiny table, the unit that held their water and air like a mechanical heart.

"Can't," Jonah said.

"Can't or won't?" Ruth asked.

He opened his mouth to pick one, then closed it. The hull ticked again. He flinched.

Ruth's eyes softened. She stepped inside and let the door slide shut behind her. The room shrank back to its own size, lit only by the narrow strip along the floor.

"Scoot over," she said.

He did. The bunk springs complained, but there was room enough for both if they kept close. Ruth sank down with a small sigh, bones and joints making their own quiet pops.

"Heard her creaking, did you?" she asked.

"She," Jonah repeated.

"The Ship," Ruth said. "You think of her as an 'it' if you like. I've lived with her long enough to give her pronouns."

Jonah stared up at the ceiling again.

"What if she breaks?" he asked. The words tumbled out before he could stop them. "What if the drill's wrong and one day it's not a drill and the metal just..." He lifted a hand, fingers curving in the air. He didn't have a word for what he meant. Coming apart. Letting go.

"Ah," Ruth said quietly.

The Ship hummed around them. Air through vents, water in pipes, some distant pump down the spine. Underneath it, the intermittent tick, tick as panels cooled.

"Come here," she said.

He scooted closer until his shoulder touched her side. She smelled like soap and the faint, lingering oil from Samuel's hull harness—she'd helped him wipe it down earlier.

"You know what my mama used to do when the sky shook back on Earth?" Ruth asked.

"You had a sky," Jonah said. It came out half-accusation, half-wonder.

"We did," she said. "And storms. Big ones. Wind howling, rain on the roof so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. When I was your size, I thought the whole house would rip up and blow away and we'd all go with it." She paused. "Your great-grandma would sit me down and pray out loud. Not because God forgot us when the clouds came, but because *I* did."

Jonah frowned. "You forgot God?"

"I forgot what held," Ruth said. "So she reminded me."

She settled her hand lightly over Jonah's, where it clenched in the blanket.

"We don't have a sky now," she went on. "We have steel and foam and clever folk who know their bolts from their beams. We have an AI watching numbers I can't pronounce. That doesn't make God smaller, Jonah. It just means we name more of His tools."

Jonah thought about the Companion voice from the drill, the one that came out of the wall without a face.

"The AI is..." He groped. "God's tool?"

"One of them," Ruth said. "Same as your father's hands. Same as these old bones when I get down on my knees." She squeezed his fingers once. "You want to pray with me?"

He hesitated.

Praying was something Samuel did before meals, words that slid past Jonah's ears while he counted rivets or thought about lesson assignments. Lydia didn't like it; she went still and tight-jawed when Samuel's voice dipped, like the air had gotten thin.

But the hull kept ticking.

"Okay," he whispered.

Ruth shifted until they were both facing the ceiling.

"We'll do it simple," she said. "Nothing fancy. You listen, and if you like the words, you can say them too."

She took a slow breath, the kind Samuel used when he was about to step out into the hull corridors.

"Lord," she said softly. "Hold the hull."

Jonah's eyes went to the faint seam where two panels met above them.

"Hold the rings," Ruth continued. "Keep their spin true."

He pictured the diagrams from school: great circles turning, people glued to the inside by pretend gravity. If they slowed, everyone would feel it. If they stopped—

He swallowed.

"Hold the air in our lungs and the water in our pipes," Ruth said. "Hold Samuel when he walks the skin." Her hand tightened again on Jonah's. "Hold Jonah when his mind runs faster than his bones."

Something fluttered in his chest at hearing his name there, tucked in with hull and rings.

"Hold the hands that hold the Ship," Ruth finished. "The welders and scrubbers, the watchers and worriers. And hold the mind that watches all this metal when we're sleeping."

Jonah knew who she meant.

"The AI," he said quietly.

"Aye," Ruth said. "She's no god. But if she's doing her job, she's one more way God keeps us from coming apart." She opened her eyes—he could feel the movement more than see it. "You want to try?"

He wet his lips.

"Lord," he said, the word strange and solid in his mouth. "Hold the hull."

The Ship hummed.

"Hold the rings," he went on. "Keep their...spin true."

Tick. Somewhere in the wall by his feet.

"Hold the hands that hold the Ship," he said, a little faster now, because the words seemed to fit together. "Dad, and the others, and...the AI that watches when we're sleeping."

The last part felt odd, like putting two puzzle pieces together that hadn't been in the same box. He pictured the Companion node above the door, its light ring dim. He tried to imagine God's hand on that metal circle too.

"Amen," Ruth murmured.

Jonah let the word sit in his chest.

The hull ticked again. He matched it in his head: *hold*. Another tick: *rings*. The slow whoosh of the vent: *hands that hold the Ship*.

"You can count them, if it helps," Ruth said quietly, as if she'd read his mind. "Clicks and hums. Not to see if she's failing, but to remember she's working."

He nodded against the pillow.

They lay there in the dim, side by side, while the Ship made its small, honest sounds. Jonah counted between the noises, fitting Ruth's words into the spaces.

Hold.

Rings.

Hands.

When his breathing finally slowed to match the vent, Ruth eased her hand free and brushed his hair back from his forehead.

"Sleep, little bird," she whispered.

The last thing he heard before he slid under was the faint, steady hum of systems doing exactly what they were meant to do, and the echo of his own voice praying for them to keep doing it.


---

The apartment was too quiet.

Quiet in a way that didn't feel like peace, or rest, or privacy. Quiet like a room waiting for something to happen. Quiet that made Jonah slow his steps without knowing why.

He rounded the corner into the kitchen.

His mother sat at the table. Not doing anything. Not drinking tea, not reading, not talking to anyone. Her hands lay flat on the surface, palms down, fingers slightly spread, as if she'd placed them there and then forgotten why.

Her eyes were open. That was the worst part.
If her eyes were closed, she'd be asleep.
If she were asleep, everything would be fine.

"Mom?" he asked.

Nothing changed.

Not her face. Not her breath. Not the angle of her body. She didn't look at him. She didn't look at anything. She wasn't gone. She just wasn't...here.

He stood there, waiting for the usual signs.
A cough. A blink. A "sorry, honey, I'm just tired."

Nothing.

A tiny pressure began behind his ribs. The kind that made it hard to breathe. He didn't know what to call it. He didn't know it was fear. Not yet.

He took a small step closer.

"Mom?"

Her jaw twitched once, like a brief misfire, and then went still. Her eyes stayed fixed on the far wall. Jonah followed her gaze but saw nothing there—just a patch of gray paneling, scuffed near the bottom where a chair had scraped it years ago.

He waited for her to move.

He waited long enough that his legs started to ache.

He didn't know what was wrong. He didn't know why she couldn't get up. He didn't know why she looked like she'd been dropped into the room from far away and hadn't landed properly.

He only knew one thing, and it came from somewhere deep and ancient inside him:

**If he got too close, something terrible would happen.**

Not to her.
To him.

That thought didn't make sense, but it wrapped itself around his spine and locked him in place.

He wanted to help.
He wanted to shake her shoulder, or get water, or call his father's name, or do whatever kids in stories did when their parents looked wrong.

But his feet wouldn't move.

He stood there with his hands clenched, nails pressing crescents into his skin. His breath came shallow, like the air near her had gotten thinner.

"Mom..." His voice broke. He hated that.

Still nothing.

Her chest rose and fell, slowly, mechanically, as if the rest of her wasn't connected to the breathing part anymore.

He felt something cold crawl up the back of his neck.
A sense that he was witnessing something he wasn't supposed to see. Something private. Something dangerous. A crack in the world.

He took one step back.

Then another.

His mother didn't react. Not even a flicker.

He turned and walked down the hallway.
Not fast.
Not running.
Just getting away. Like his body knew how far was safe even if his mind didn't.

He stopped in his bedroom doorway and pressed his back against the frame.

He waited again.
He told himself she would call his name any second.
She always did.

But the apartment stayed silent.

He stayed there until he heard the outer door slide open—Samuel's boots on the metal floor, the soft thud of him setting down his tool bag, the quiet, tired sigh of a man expecting to step back into normal life.

Jonah didn't move.

He heard his father pause when he saw the kitchen.
He heard a sharp inhale—Samuel noticing what Jonah had seen.
He didn't hear words. His father didn't speak right away.

Jonah closed his eyes.

He didn't go back into the kitchen.
He didn't check on her.
He didn't answer when Samuel called his name, voice tight and worried.

He stayed exactly where he was, breathing shallow, heart beating too fast, trying to convince himself he hadn't done anything wrong.

He was only seven.

He didn't know that walking away would carve a line in his life he'd feel forever.

He didn't know that this moment—the freeze, the fear, the retreat—would return in dreams and memories and choices he couldn't explain.

He didn't know he would carry it like a quiet bruise under his ribs for decades.

He only knew his mother had been hurting, and he had walked away.

And no matter how small he was, or how frozen, or how scared, the guilt of that simple truth curled itself around his heart and never let go.
