# Chapter 3: Logged

The mediation room tried very hard not to look like trouble.

Someone had painted the walls a soft blue instead of the usual ship gray. There was a strip of fake grass along one side—a narrow, carefully contained patch of green under a grow panel—and a low shelf with a few worn toys: stacking rings, a puzzle board missing one animal, a soft cube with numbers stitched on each face. The air smelled faintly of cleaner and something sweet Jonah couldn't name.

He sat in a chair sized for kids his age, feet flat for once instead of dangling. Two other boys sat to his left and right, identical gray school tunics rumpled from the scuffle that had brought them here. One had a reddening mark on his wrist; the other kept rubbing his elbow as if expecting it to start hurting.

Across from them, on the far wall, a Companion node sat in a recessed niche above a small table. Its light ring was dim, a soft, steady glow.

"This isn't a punishment," the proctor had said. "It's just a chance to talk about what happened."

"Right," Jonah had answered, even though his stomach had already started to knot the way it did during emergency drills.

Now the proctor—a woman with tired eyes and a badge that read E. KATO—sat on the edge of the fake grass strip, hands folded loosely. She smiled in a way that tried not to be a performance.

"Okay," she said. "We're almost done with school for today. Let's just take a few minutes together and see if we can understand each other a little better."

Jonah focused on the seam where the wall panel met the floor. If he kept his eyes on something solid, the room might stay the size it was.

"Companion," Kato said. "Please start the log."

The node chimed, a small, ascending tone.

"Behavioral Stability Mediation," it said. The voice was neutral, a little higher than the one in Jonah's apartment. "Date: cycle one-nine-four-seven, ring C. Participants: student Jonah Hale, student Rafi Yen, student Tomas Kwe. Facilitator: Instructor E. Kato. Recording begins."

Stability. The word made Jonah think of hull plates and grav rings, not boys in a hallway.

"Hi," Kato said, looking at each of them in turn. "I'm Instructor Kato. Thank you for coming in with me instead of going straight home. I know that's not fun."

Tomas shrugged, eyes on his shoes. Rafi scowled in the direction of the door.

"Let's start simple," Kato went on. "Who wants to tell me what happened by the south viewport this morning?"

"He pushed me," Rafi said immediately, jabbing a thumb toward Jonah. "For no reason."

"That's not true," Jonah said. His voice came out tighter than he meant. "You were leaning over the rail."

"Everyone leans," Rafi shot back. "It's just a viewport."

Jonah's heart sped up. "It's above a drop," he said. "If you slip—"

"There's a second rail," Rafi interrupted. "And a net. I'm not a baby."

Kato raised a hand. "One at a time," she said. "Rafi, thank you. Jonah, we'll come back to you. Tomas? What did you see?"

Tomas shifted. "Rafi was doing the thing," he muttered.

"What thing?" Kato asked.

"Leaning," Tomas said. "Like he said. Right over the top rail."

"I wasn't over it," Rafi protested. "I had my feet back."

"You were laughing," Tomas added, ignoring him. "And going like—" He mimed tipping forward, arms out. "Like in vids."

Jonah's hands clenched on his knees.

"And then?" Kato prompted.

"Then Jonah grabbed him," Tomas said. "From behind."

"Pushed," Rafi corrected.

"Pulled," Tomas said stubbornly. "He yanked you back. You fell."

"He threw me," Rafi insisted. "On purpose."

Kato let them talk it out for a moment, then cut in gently.

"Okay," she said. "Different words, same event. Rafi ended up on the floor. Jonah, tell me what you remember." 

He swallowed. The viewport scene replayed in his head in perfect detail: the arc of Rafi's body over the rail, the gap below, the memory of his father's boots on the very real skin of the hull far, far beneath places like that.

"He was leaning," Jonah said. "Too far. His weight was over the guard. If something shook or—" He stopped himself before he said if the hull gave.

"There are safeties," Rafi muttered.

"What did you think would happen?" Kato asked Jonah.

"I thought he was going to fall," Jonah said. His fingers dug into the fabric of his pants. "Down. All the way."

"That's impossible," Rafi said. He laughed, but it came out thin. "There's a net."

"I didn't know how far," Jonah said. "Or if the net was checked. Or if he'd hit the rail wrong. It only takes one—" He bit the rest off.

Kato's expression stayed neutral, but something in it softened.

"So you grabbed him," she said.

"Yes."

"Why did you grab him the way you did?"

He hadn't meant to. That was the worst part. He had just moved—hand catching the back of Rafi's tunic, yanking hard enough that the other boy's feet had left the ground. There had been a second where both of them were off balance; Jonah remembered the sick tilt in his own stomach as much as Rafi's shout.

"I didn't think," Jonah said. "I just—" He mimed the motion, quick and ugly. "Pulled."

"Did you want him to get hurt?" Kato asked.

"No," he said, too fast. "I was trying to stop him from—" The word falling jammed in his throat. "If something happened to him and I didn't do anything, it would be my fault."

The Companion's light ring brightened a fraction, a note in its buffer.

"Observation," it said quietly. "Subject expresses heightened sense of personal responsibility for others' safety."

Kato shot it a look. "Log it, don't interrupt," she said.

"Apologies," the AI replied. Its tone did not change.

She turned back to the boys. "Rafi," she said. "How did it feel when Jonah pulled you?"

"It hurt," he said. "And it was embarrassing. Everyone looked."

"Did you feel scared?" she asked.

He hesitated. "For a second," he admitted. "When my feet came up."

"Thank you," she said. "Tomas?"

"I thought he was gonna go over," Tomas said quietly. "For real."

Kato nodded. "So," she said, "it sounds like there were a lot of feelings at once. Rafi felt embarrassed and a little scared. Tomas felt scared. Jonah felt...what?" She glanced at him.

"Scared," he said. The word felt too small. "If he fell it would be because I didn't stop it."

"Or," Rafi muttered, "because you pushed me."

"Enough," Kato said, not unkindly. "We're not here to decide who's bad. We're here to decide how to keep everyone safe next time."

The word bad still stuck to Jonah's ribs.

"Companion," Kato said. "Please record individual follow-ups. Group section ends."

"Acknowledged," the node said. "Group portion concluded. Behavioral Stability Log updated."

She sent Rafi and Tomas out first, promising they'd only be a minute and then could go back to class. The door hissed closed behind them, leaving Jonah alone with Kato and the AI.

The room seemed bigger with fewer bodies, and somehow emptier at the same time.

"Jonah," Kato said. "I'm not angry with you."

His throat tightened. "The log is," he said.

A small smile tugged at her mouth. "The log doesn't get angry. It gets full. There's a difference."

He didn't see it.

"I need to ask you a few questions just for you," she went on. "Is that okay?"

It wasn't, but saying no felt like a different kind of trouble.

"Okay," he said.

She glanced up at the node. "Companion?"

"Individual segment," it said. "Subject: Jonah Hale."

Kato rested her elbows on her knees, bringing her face closer to his level. "Have you been sleeping okay lately?" she asked.

He thought about the nights he'd lain awake counting the tiny creaks in the walls, listening for the thread of his mother's breathing in the next room.

"Sometimes," he said.

"Sometimes yes or sometimes no?" she asked gently.

"Sometimes it's hard," he said. "If there was a drill that day. Or if the lights flicker. Or if Mom—" He cut himself off.

Kato didn't pounce on the unfinished word. "If Mom what?" she asked, voice as neutral as the AI's.

He stared at his hands. "If she's…quiet." The memory of the kitchen table pressed in on him. "I listen to make sure she's breathing. Then I can't stop listening."

The Companion's light flared slightly.

"Observation," it said. "Subject reports hypervigilance in response to parental withdrawal."

"Log it," Kato repeated. "Don't perform it."

"Logged," the AI said.

She shifted her attention fully back to Jonah. "Do you feel like you have to watch other people all the time?" she asked. "Make sure they're safe?"

"If I don't, something bad will happen," he said. The words surprised him by how quickly they came.

"And it would be your fault," she prompted.

He nodded, once.

"Even if you didn't cause it?" she asked.

He nodded again.

"Do you ever feel like your feelings are…too big?" she asked. "Like they might hurt people if they get out?"

He thought of the way his hands had moved without asking him in the hallway. The way his voice sometimes came out too loud when he was scared.

"Yes," he whispered.

"Do you tell anyone when you feel that way?" she asked.

"My dad," he said. "Sometimes."

"What does he say?"

"That it's okay to be scared," Jonah said. "That fear doesn't make me bad."

Kato's eyes went softer around the edges. "He's right," she said.

"But the log—" he started.

"The log isn't about good or bad," she said. "It's about patterns. So that if something hurts you, or starts to, the Ship can see it and send help."

He stared at the glowing ring above the table. It looked like an eye that never blinked.

"Is it looking at me now?" he asked.

"It's listening," she said. "Like I am."

"Will it remember?" he asked.

"Yes," the AI answered before she could. "This record will be preserved as part of your Behavioral Stability Log."

There was a small, almost inaudible chime as it said it. Jonah felt something inside him click in response.

"Who sees it?" he asked.

"Your instructors," Kato said. "Certain clinicians. The system that helps assign training later on. They use it to understand how best to support you." She hesitated. "And to make sure no one ends up carrying more than they can handle alone."

He thought of his mother, alone at the table. "What if they decide I'm carrying too much?" he asked.

Kato did not answer right away. Her gaze flicked, just once, toward the node.

"Then," she said slowly, "we find ways to lighten the load."

The Companion added, "Flag: subject Jonah Hale marked for periodic follow-up. Risk index: elevated sensitivity, elevated self-blame, no current indicators of active instability. Recommendation: monitor."

Monitor.

The word lodged under his sternum. It tasted like the pause before an alarm.

"Thank you, Jonah," Kato said. "You did well. You can go back to class now."

He stood on legs that felt a little unsteady. At the door, he hesitated.

"Is there a number?" he asked without knowing he was going to.

"A number?" she repeated.

"On…me," he said. "In the log. Like how likely I am to…" He couldn't finish the sentence.

Kato's mouth opened, then closed. "Numbers are just tools," she said carefully. "They don't get to decide who you are."

"Do I have one?" he pressed.

The Companion spoke.

"Current composite stability index: four point three on a ten-scale, with adjustment factors for environment and family context," it said.

Four point three. The specificity of it made his skin crawl.

"That is not a sentence," Kato said sharply. "It's an internal marker."

"Internal," Jonah echoed.

"It helps us notice if something changes," she said. "That's all."

He nodded, though nothing inside him agreed.

In the corridor outside, the noise of regular school life washed over him: footsteps, laughter, the distant call of an instructor. It all sounded thinner than before.

As he walked back toward his band, Jonah became newly aware of the Companion nodes tucked into the ceilings at intervals, their rings dim, their lenses small and dark.

He had always known they were there. Today, for the first time, he understood that somewhere behind them, a version of him now existed as a line on a graph, a number on a scale, a file that would grow without his help.

If he broke, the Ship would be able to say it had seen it coming.

If he didn't, it would be able to say it had watched.


---

Years later, in the hull corridors, the Ship's watching felt different.

The first thing Jonah noticed out here was the sound.

In the habitat bands, noise blurred together—voices, vents, distant rail hum, the background thrum of a world pretending to be whole. Here, in the hull corridors, the ship's voice narrowed. It became a set of distinct notes: pump vibration through metal, faint tick of thermal expansion, the low, almost subsonic growl of reaction mass shifting somewhere far away.

Samuel clipped Jonah's tether to the guide rail with a soft, practiced motion.

"Check it," Samuel said.

Jonah tugged. The line went tight against his harness, then settled. The corridor around them was narrow enough that Samuel's shoulders nearly brushed both walls. Anchor points studded the deck and ceiling like a second, smaller constellation.

"Suit seals?" Samuel asked.

"Green," Jonah said.

"Mag soles?"

Jonah flexed his boots. They answered with a muted click as the field cycled.

"Good." Samuel nodded once. "Stay on my left. If you feel lightheaded, you tell me before you lie to yourself about it."

Jonah tried to smile. It came out thinner than he liked.

"I'm fine," he said.

Samuel gave him a look—the quiet, assessing kind that meant he'd heard the word and the strain under it.

"You don't have to impress me out here," Samuel said. "The hull doesn't care how brave you act. It only cares if you listen."

He turned and started forward, boots clicking in slow, deliberate rhythm along the mag track. Jonah followed, tether line whispering against the guide rail.

The corridor curved gently with the ship's hull. Overhead, bundles of cable and fluid lines ran in tight parallel, labeled with codes Jonah had half-memorized from training feeds. Every few meters, a service hatch broke the monotony: manual valves, inspection ports, an occasional viewport the size of Jonah's hand, sealed over in thick, dark glass.

Beyond those ports, he knew, there was nothing.

Not sky, not air, not anything that would catch them if the metal gave way. Just the long, empty dark the old vids showed when they talked about pre-launch telescopes.

He did not look too long at the glass.

Samuel moved like the corridor was an old friend he trusted and still tested. His hand brushed each anchor point as they passed, a small tap Jonah had once thought was superstition.

"Is that for luck?" Jonah had asked, years ago, watching Samuel do the same thing before leaving for a shift.

Samuel had smiled then. "It's for attention," he'd said. "Reminds me there's something between me and the dark, and it's only as good as the last time somebody checked it."

Now, walking beside him, Jonah saw the habit in context. Every tap was a question: still solid? still sealed? still holding?

"You can hear it better out here," Samuel said.

"Hear what?"

"The ship." Samuel stopped, head tilted slightly, one gloved hand pressed to the wall. "She talks different in the hull. When something's wrong, it starts as… not a sound, exactly. A change in how all the other sounds fit together."

Jonah paused too, unsure what he was supposed to be listening for. To him, the corridor hummed and ticked the way the training simulations had, only sharper, more real. Underneath it all was that faint, endless pressure: the knowledge of vacuum sitting just beyond layers of composite and alloy.

"Your Companion could chart it for you," Samuel said, "but charts don't give you instincts. Instincts keep you alive when you're tired or scared."

"Companions don't get tired or scared," Jonah said.

Samuel's mouth twitched. "Exactly."

They walked on.

After a while, the corridor narrowed further, forcing them into single file. The light strips along the floor dimmed for a moment as some distant system rebalanced load. Jonah's breath stumbled, memory flashing to nursery rhymes about the dark outside: *Stay inside, hold the line, trust the shell to hold in time.*

The light steadied again. Samuel hadn't even paused.

"You felt that?" he asked over his shoulder.

"Yeah."

"Power shuffle in another sector," Samuel said. "Nothing to do with us. But if it repeats, or lasts longer? That's when you start asking questions."

"Out loud?" Jonah asked. "Or to the AI?"

Samuel gave a soft huff that might have been a laugh.

"Both," he said. "Preferably in that order."

They reached a junction where three corridors met. A small alcove held a manual console, stripped-down and functional: pressure indicators, seal status, a fold-out display. A Companion icon pulsed faintly in the corner.

"Local node," Samuel said. "Companion, status."

The icon brightened, forming a simple voice-only interface.

"Section H-47C nominal," the Companion said. "No current anomalies on this route. Hello, Samuel. Hello, Jonah."

Jonah felt the familiar prickle at the base of his skull when it said his name. He wondered, crazily, if this local instance knew his stability score, if it could see that his heart rate had jumped when the lights dimmed.

"Morning," Samuel said. "Log inspection start, route delta-seven."

"Logged," the Companion replied. "Exterior plate array F-19 indicates minor thermal stress variance within acceptable range. Recommend visual check if you are passing that point."

"That's where we're headed," Samuel said. "Thank you."

"You're welcome," the AI said, then dimmed itself back to background awareness.

Samuel glanced at Jonah. "Tools?"

Jonah patted the kit at his hip. "Check."

"Good. Come on, then. Let's go make sure 'acceptable' still means what it used to."

They moved into the branch corridor. It felt even closer here, one side sloping inward where the outer hull thickened around a structural rib. Jonah's mind insisted on drawing a cross-section: bodies, metal, then the thin gray line of vacuum beyond.

His palms were damp inside his gloves.

"Breathe," Samuel said quietly, without looking back. "In for four. Hold for four. Out for six."

Jonah obeyed before he could argue. The rhythm steadied his steps.

"You scared?" Samuel asked.

Jonah hesitated. He wanted to say no. He wanted to be the kind of son who walked these corridors with the same unbothered ease.

"A little," he said instead.

Samuel nodded, as if that were the correct answer.

"Good," he said. "Means you understand what's outside. Fear's not the enemy out here. Forgetting is."

They stopped at a hatch marked with yellow bands. Samuel keyed in his authorization; the inner door cycled open to reveal a small lock chamber with another door at the far end.

"Not going outside today," Samuel said, catching Jonah's brief stiffening. "Just checking plate temps and mounts from inboard. Baby steps."

Jonah swallowed. "Okay."

Inside the lock chamber, Samuel connected a diagnostic lead from the console to a port by the hatch. A schematic bloomed on the small screen, lines and numbers Jonah followed with half-trained eyes.

"See that?" Samuel pointed to a cluster of readings tinted orange. "Thermal variance. Within spec, like the Companion said, but creeping. Metal gets tired same as people. You listen when it tells you."

He rested his hand on the bulkhead again, fingers splayed.

"Same with people," he added.

Jonah watched his father's hand on the metal.

"What if it doesn't tell you?" Jonah asked, before he could stop himself. "If it just… holds everything until it doesn't?"

Samuel was quiet for a long moment. The only sound was the faint buzz of the console.

"Then you pay attention to the little things," Samuel said. "Hairline cracks. Strange noises. Folks getting quieter instead of louder when they're hurting."

He looked at Jonah then, really looked, as if measuring more than vitals.

"You can't fix everything," Samuel said. "Not plates, not people. But you can stand where you're meant to stand, and you can listen. That's what trust looks like, to me."

"Trust what?" Jonah asked.

Samuel shrugged one shoulder. "Materials. The people who checked them before you. The AI when it tells you something's wrong. God, when there's nothing else to lean on."

He tapped the bulkhead twice, the same way he tapped anchor points.

"And yourself, eventually," he added.

Jonah looked at the numbers again. The orange cluster sat there, contained but undeniable.

"What if I'm the part that fails?" Jonah asked, the words slipping out softer than he meant.

Samuel's face didn't change, but something in his posture did. He turned fully toward Jonah, hands loose at his sides.

"Then we patch," Samuel said simply. "We brace. We take weight off that section until it can carry it again. Nobody throws the ship away because one plate needs attention."

He let that sit for a beat.

"You're not a single point of failure, son," he said. "Not in this family. Not on this ship. You hear me?"

Jonah nodded, but the old fear still pressed at his ribs, tied to a kitchen chair and a mother who didn't look up.

Samuel, as if guessing the direction of his thoughts, reached out and rested a hand on Jonah's shoulder—not heavy, just steady.

"I know it's loud in there sometimes," he said. "I see it, even when you don't say it. But loud doesn't mean broken. It just means we pay attention."

He squeezed once, then released.

"Now," he said, practical again, "tell me what you'd recommend for this variance if it shows up on your board, three shifts from now, when I'm not standing next to you."

Jonah forced his mind back to the schematic. He traced heat paths, thought through material tolerances, imagined the worst case the way his training urged and his anxiety excelled at.

"Flag it for monitoring," he said slowly. "Schedule a closer inspection. Maybe rotate load away from this section if the model says it's cheap enough."

"And if the AI says the model doesn't justify it?" Samuel asked.

Jonah hesitated. "Then I… accept the risk?"

Samuel shook his head, half-smiling.

"Then you ask again," he said. "You give it better data, better questions. You don't bully it and you don't worship it. You work with it. Same as any partner."

He turned back to the console, fingers moving with practiced care.

"Faith's like that too," he added, almost as an afterthought. "You don't get all the answers you want. You just keep bringing what you have, and you keep listening for what's real."

They finished the checks in small, absorbing steps—tightening a fastener here, logging a minor discrepancy there. Outside, unseen, the dark pressed evenly against the hull. Inside, the ship hummed and breathed and carried them all forward.

On the way back, Jonah found his steps matching Samuel's rhythm without thinking. Tap, tap, tap on the anchor points; breathe in for four, hold for four, out for six.

He was still afraid.

But walking there, tether linked to his father and his boots holding firm to the track, he felt something else layered over the fear: a sense that the thin metal between them and the dark was not the only thing keeping him from falling.

Samuel glanced over, as if he could see that shift on Jonah's face.

"Not so bad, is it?" he asked.

Jonah looked down the long, narrow corridor, then up at the maze of lines and plates that made their world possible.

"No," he said. "Not so bad."

He didn't add: *As long as you're here.*

He didn't have to. Samuel seemed to hear it anyway.
