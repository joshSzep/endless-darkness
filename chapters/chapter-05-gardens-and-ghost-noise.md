# Chapter 5: Gardens and Ghost Noise

Hydroponics smelled wrong for a place made of metal.

The corridor outside had the usual ship-scent: warmed alloy, recycled air, the faint soap of overused cleaners. But the moment Jonah stepped through the pressure door into Sector G-3, the air thickened. It met his face like a soft, damp cloth—humid, green, laced with faintly sour nutrient and something almost like soil.

His glasses fogged at the edges before the adaptive coating caught up.

"Welcome to hydroponics," the Companion at the entrance said, its voice a gentle murmur from a ceiling node. "Please mind the moisture gradients and watch your footing near open channels."

"Logged," Jonah said automatically.

He adjusted the strap on his tool bag and scanned his wrist display. The ticket that had routed him here blinked patiently: *Nutrient flow anomaly, row cluster 7B. Severity: Low. Technician: Hale, Jonah.*

Low severity. Simple fix. In theory.

Rows of greenery stretched away under grow-lights in long, careful lines: towers of leafy vines, waist-high troughs humming with circulation, trellises supporting something broad and dark and unfamiliar. The artificial day-cycle here was a softer spectrum than in the corridors, a warm wash that made the condensation on pipes look almost like morning.

Jonah had seen gardens before, on vids and quick walk-throughs. He had never been assigned to one. His work usually lived where metal met code, where the only green came from status indicators.

"You’re late," someone called from between the rows.

He turned, heart giving a small, stupid kick.

Sera Solano stepped out from behind a column of climbing plants, forearms wet to the elbow. Her coverall sleeves were rolled up and spattered with dark flecks; her hair was pulled back in a knot that had started neat and surrendered to humidity hours ago.

"Sorry," Jonah said. "Lift pause. And a misrouted cart." He realized, halfway through, that she had probably been joking.

Sera wiped her hands on a rag clipped to her belt and eyed him for a second, head tilted.

"Relax," she said. "The tomatoes aren’t going anywhere. Row 7B?"

"Yeah." He checked his display again, though he already knew. "Minor flow irregularity. Companion flagged it."

"It flagged it," she echoed. "It’s been having opinions all morning. Come on."

She turned without waiting, weaving back into the rows. Jonah followed, careful not to brush against leaves that reached into the aisle like hands.

As they walked, the sounds of the gardens assembled themselves around him: the soft rush of water through channels, the whisper of air movers, the subtle creak of plant support frames settling under their own weight. People here moved more slowly than in the main corridors. A pair of workers farther down bent over a tray of seedlings, talking in low voices that dissolved into the general green hush.

"First time with us?" Sera asked over her shoulder.

"On assignment, yeah," Jonah said. "My father brought us once. When I was little. Different sector."

"You didn’t come back?" she asked.

"I live in corridors," he said, then immediately regretted how that sounded. "I mean—I work in—"

She laughed, quiet and real.

"I know what you mean," she said. "Don’t worry. The plants won’t take it personally."

They turned into a narrower aisle. At the far end, a line of indicator lights along a nutrient pipe blinked out of sync with their neighbors.

"Seven B," Sera said. "Your big moment."

Jonah exhaled slowly through his nose and crouched by the pipe. The panel lifted under his fingers, releasing a puff of warm, mineral scent. His wrist display synced with the local sensors, lines of numbers blooming into graphs.

"Companion," he said. "Show me flow history for seven bravo, last six hours."

A muted chime sounded from the nearby wall.

"Displaying," the local AI said. A small projection appeared on the underside of the open panel, lines of color tracking slight dips and rises.

Sera leaned her hip against the nearest support post, watching the plants instead of the graph.

"It’s been sulking since mid-shift," she said. "You tell me why."

He almost smiled. *Sulking.* It wasn’t how he thought about systems. They failed or they didn’t; they stayed in spec or they didn’t. But the word fit here in a way he couldn’t quite name.

He traced the graph with his fingertip, following the shallow valleys.

"Small lag in return flow," he said. "Nothing dramatic. But if it keeps drifting…"

"They start complaining," Sera finished, nodding toward the plants. "They like their consistency."

He looked up involuntarily. The leaves along this row did look different—edges a little duller, stems angled not quite like their neighbors. He hadn’t noticed until she pointed.

"So," she said. "Is it a sensor lying, or a pipe grumbling?"

Jonah felt the familiar part of his brain kick in, the one that liked clean problems. "Valve assembly here," he said, tapping a section on the schematic. "If the servo’s slow, you’d see exactly this pattern. No alarms, but a mismatch between demand and response."

"Can you fix it without making me shut down a whole row?" she asked.

"I can try," he said.

She made a small, approving sound and crouched beside him, close enough that he could feel the warmth radiating from her damp skin. She smelled like nutrient solution and something sharp and green underneath.

"Show me," she said.

He could feel his throat tighten the way it sometimes did in evaluations, when too many eyes were on him. He reminded himself there was only one person here, and she was already up to her elbows in the system he was supposedly here to help.

"If I reroute flow through the adjacent loop for five minutes," he said, fingers moving over the interface, "I can take the valve offline long enough to re-seat it and run a local test. No interruption to root feed longer than they’d notice."

"‘They,’" Sera said. "You’re learning."

He risked a sideways glance. Her mouth was quirking, but her eyes were steady.

"I usually talk about systems like they’re just…systems," he said.

"They are," she said. "And they’re also the reason people don’t starve. And the reason some people have a place to go when they can’t stand another minute in metal corridors. Both things can be true."

He thought of Alina, curled up on a bench with a sketch pad, drawing imaginary trees she’d never see. Of his mother staring past the kitchen wall. Of Samuel’s hand on the hull plates.

The valve assembly came free with a reluctant twist. He worked in silence for a minute, cleaning grit from the housing, reseating contacts, the small, precise tasks his hands trusted even when his head didn’t.

"You always narrate like that when you work?" Sera asked quietly.

He blinked. "Like what?"

"Like you’re giving a presentation to someone who might fail you," she said. "Every step justified, no room for doubt."

Heat rose under his collar.

"It’s just how I learned," he said. "In training. You explain everything or they assume you’re guessing."

"And out here?" She gestured with her chin toward the rows. "Who’s grading you? The lettuce?"

He huffed, more breath than laugh.

"Old habits," he said.

"Mm." She watched him for another moment, then moved to the next trough, fingers sliding into the nutrient solution to check flow over the roots. Her touch was efficient, practiced.

"For what it’s worth," she added, eyes on the plants, "you sound like you know what you’re doing. When you’re not trying to prove you’re allowed to breathe."

The words landed in his chest with an unexpected weight. He tightened one last connection and reinstalled the valve.

"Companion," he said. "Bring seven bravo back online. Run local diagnostic."

"Re-engaging," the AI replied. Numbers ticked upward on his display, smoothing into a cleaner line. "Flow normalized. No further anomalies detected. Thank you, Jonah. Thank you, Sera."

"You’re welcome," Sera said automatically, then rolled her eyes toward the ceiling. "You see? Opinions."

"It’s not wrong," he said. "About the anomaly."

"I know," she said. "I just don’t like it thinking it runs everything."

There was no heat in it, only a mild wariness. Jonah recognized it, a distant cousin to his own fear.

"You don’t trust it?" he asked.

"I trust it to do exactly what it was built to do," she said. "Keep the ship alive. That’s not the same as keeping any of us comfortable. Or whole."

She straightened and wiped her hands again, then looked at him fully.

"I trust people," she said. "Specific ones. When they earn it."

He didn’t know what to do with the way she said that, or the small, assessing pause that followed. He fell back on the safer topic.

"Flow’s stable now," he said. "You shouldn’t see any more sulking. If it drifts again, we can schedule a full replacement."

"We," she repeated.

"Maintenance and hydroponics," he clarified quickly. "Not—"

"Relax," she said again, and this time there was a smile in it. "I like ‘we.’ Makes the place feel less lonely."

A worker down the row called Sera’s name. She lifted a hand in acknowledgment without taking her eyes off Jonah.

"You know you can come through here when you’re not on a ticket, right?" she said. "It’s not just for people who have official business."

"I don’t really…wander," he said.

"Figured," she said. "Still. The door opens for more than broken valves."

He nodded, unsure if he’d ever take her up on it. The idea of walking into this humid, living space without a system to fix felt…indulgent. Exposed.

"Thanks for the assist," she said, stepping back. "You saved me a headache and the plants a bad day."

"Just did my job," he said.

"Some people do their job and make more work for us later," she said. "You paid attention. That’s different."

He didn’t have an answer for that. She didn’t seem to need one.

"Next time," she added, already turning toward the next row, "if your route just happens to cut by the gardens again, I can show you the section where we keep the plants that don’t go into anyone’s lunch. The pretty ones."

"There are pretty ones?" he asked, before he could stop himself.

She glanced back over her shoulder, eyes bright in the soft light.

"You’ll see," she said.

Then she was gone, lost between columns of green.

Jonah closed the panel and sealed it. The air felt thicker now, but not in a way that made it hard to breathe. The Companion at the entrance pinged an idle question at the edge of his interface—*Would you like to rate your experience in Sector G-3?*—and he dismissed it without answering.

On his way out, he hesitated by the pressure door.

He looked back once, down the long row where Sera moved, shoulders squared, hands steady, part of the rhythm of the place. The gardens seemed to watch him without accusation.

He stepped into the corridor’s thin, dry air and felt it close around him like a familiar, narrow coat.

For the first time in a long while, the thought came uninvited and almost gentle:

Maybe there was a place on the ship where his presence didn’t feel like a risk waiting to be tallied.

He filed the notion away with the ticket, under a label he didn’t yet have words for.

---

The bench outside hydroponics was technically not a bench.

It was a stretch of reinforced conduit casing that happened to sit under a bank of status strips, at exactly the right height for tired workers to drop onto while they waited for the lift. Someone had added a strip of foam padding a few cycles back, taped in place with the kind of determination that told Jonah this was no longer an accident of architecture. The Ship had grown a bench whether it wanted to or not.

He sat on the left end, back to the cool metal of the wall, fingers loosely wrapped around a cup of lukewarm tea.

Third shift in G-3 had just ended. The corridor outside the sector door was in that brief overlap between teams: gardeners and stewards peeling off, other workers in gray and blue streaming past on their own routes. A faint mist still clung to Sera’s sleeves from the last cycle of the misters; droplets caught the light like they were reluctant to leave.

"You’re making that face again," she said, dropping onto the right end of the bench with a small sigh.

"Which face?" he asked.

"The one that says you’re analyzing the status lights for fun instead of talking to a person," she said.

He looked up at the strips out of reflex. Moisture levels, nutrient flow, a band of soft green across the top that meant everything inside was within tolerance. He’d already noticed the minor oscillation in loop D; it was within margin. He dragged his gaze back down.

"They’re very soothing," he said. "Stable graphs. No one yelling."

"You're allowed to like two things at once," Sera said. She set her own cup down between her knees. Steam had mostly given up. "Lights and human company. It's not an either-or situation."

"For some of us it feels like a resource conflict," he said.

A corner of her mouth twitched.

"You say that like a man whose brain is running too many processes," she said.

"Pot, kettle," he said.

They sat in companionable silence for a few breaths. The corridor hum filled in around them: distant lift chimes, the murmur of voices, the faint hiss of the sector door cycling open and shut as volunteers trickled out.

"You hear it, then," she said, after a while.

"Hear what?" he asked.

"The Ship," she said. "You talk about it like a machine most of the time. But when you’re tired, you talk about it like a person with moods."

He stared into his tea.

"I hear…patterns," he said. "Hum changes, power redistributions. The way the vents shift on certain cycles." He rolled his shoulders, as if to shake off the memory of the maintenance corridor flicker. "Sometimes it’s just noise. Sometimes it feels like…"

He groped for a word that didn’t sound like a confession.

"Like it’s breathing," he settled on. "Louder or quieter depending on where you stand."

"Hmm," Sera said.

"You don’t?" he asked.

"I hear it," she said. "It’s just…background. Like wind in a garden dome. I notice when something’s wrong in my sectors, sure. A pump whine, a bad valve. But most of the time it’s just there so the silence doesn’t feel like the void."

He watched her hand as she wrapped it around her cup. Small calluses from trellis ties, a faint scar along one knuckle from a tool slip. She moved like someone who trusted the floor to stay where it was.

"When it's quiet," he said, "I start waiting for the crack."

"Even in here?" she asked. "In the greens?"

"Especially in corridors," he said. "Less so in your jungle." He tried to make it a joke. "The plants are too loud."

"Rude," she said. "They work very hard at respiration."

He huffed a breath that was almost a laugh.

"You know Ruth used to pray for the hull," he said, surprising himself. "Hand on the wall. Like it was a person who could be tired."

"She told me once," Sera said. "When I ran into her near the chapel. She said she asked God to hold the hands that hold the Ship." She nudged his shoulder lightly with hers. "You realize that includes you, right?"

"Feels presumptuous," he said. "Putting myself in the same sentence as the hull."

"You’re the one who hears it breathing," she said. "Seems fair."

They watched a group of younger volunteers file past, laughing too loudly, their uniforms still damp from the last mist cycle. One of them tripped over the seam in the floor near the sector door. Sera winced in sympathetic pain even as she smiled.

"First week," she said. "He’ll learn."

"Or the Ship will relocate the seam just to mess with him," Jonah said.

"Now who’s giving it moods?" she asked.

He let the teasing sit. It was easier than saying: my mother talked to the walls when she was coming apart, and I don’t know how much of that I’ve inherited.

"For what it's worth," Sera said, after a quiet stretch, "I don’t mind that you listen. To the Ship. To people."

He glanced at her. "Some people find it unnerving."

"Some people don’t like knowing anyone is paying that much attention," she said. "But out there"—she jerked her chin toward the unseen hull—"I’d rather have the man who hears the difference between a tired pump and a dying one. In here, I’d rather have the friend who notices when I’ve had three bad shifts in a row."

Friend. The word landed somewhere behind his ribs and made a small, unsteady space.

"You say that now," he said. "Wait until I start sending you annotated logs of your sleep cycles."

"If you ever get my sleep data without my consent," she said, "I will make you repot every single citrus tree in B-ring with your bare hands."

He smiled, small but real.

"Fair consequences," he said.

The lift down the corridor chimed, doors whooshing open. A cluster of workers stepped out, another cluster got in. The flow of bodies shifted.

"You on next shift already?" he asked.

"No," she said. "I should go home. Pretend I sleep." She rose, then hesitated, hand hovering near his shoulder as if to steady herself on a ship that wasn't actually moving differently. "You?"

"Back toward the spine," he said. "Reports. More screens." He lifted his cup. "And tea that tastes like it’s been sitting under a status light for an hour."

"Shipboard delicacy," she said.

For a second, neither of them moved.

"You know the sound you make when you’re not talking?" she said.

He blinked. "I make a sound when I’m not talking?"

"Hmm," she said. "More like—" She mimicked, gently: a quiet exhale through her nose, the kind of almost-sigh that sat between vigilance and rest. "You’ve been making that less out here."

"Less?" he asked.

"Yeah," she said. "In the gardens you hum sometimes instead. I like that one better."

He felt heat rise to his face, absurdly.

"I do not hum," he said.

"You absolutely do," she said. "We’ll gather evidence." She tapped the rim of his cup lightly. "Come back next shift. The peppers miss you."

"Pretty sure they don’t," he said.

"I do," she said, and then, before he could decide what to do with that, she stepped away into the moving corridor, letting the crowd carry her toward the lifts.

The bench felt different without her there, empty in a way that had nothing to do with mass.

Jonah looked up once more at the status strips. Moisture, flow, all in the green. Behind them, deeper in the metal, he could hear the lower, steadier hum of the Ship doing its endless work.

He listened for a few breaths, then let his shoulders drop by a millimeter.

"Hold the hands that hold the Ship," he heard Ruth say in memory.

For the first time, he allowed that maybe those hands included his, and maybe, improbably, Sera’s too.

He finished his tea, such as it was, and rose to join the flow, carrying the echo of her I do with him toward the next bank of screens.

---

By third shift, the maintenance corridor had emptied into echoes.

Most of the crew were already riding the lift back toward the warmer bands of the habitat cylinder, their voices and boot-strikes fading into the general hum. Jonah had stayed behind to clear one more ticket—a nuisance flag on a sensor junction that hadn’t tripped hard enough to bump itself to someone older.

He told himself he liked this hour. No supervisors, no cluster of trainees crowding his elbow. Just him, the ship, and the clean, rectangular line of the corridor stretching ahead.

The air had a metallic taste out here, faint ozone under recycled warmth. Light strips ran along the ceiling in regular intervals, bleached white that made small imperfections in the plating stand out: a scuff, a hairline scratch, a smear of old sealant. His boots clicked in steady rhythm on the grating.

Ordinary, he thought. Boring. Safe.

He closed the junction panel, double-checked the readouts on his wrist display, and logged the fix.

"Ticket cleared," he said out of habit.

"Acknowledged," the local Companion replied from the wall node beside him. "Thank you, Jonah. Routing update to central logs." Its voice was mild, unhurried.

He slung the tool bag over his shoulder and turned toward the long walk back.

Three steps later, the lights dimmed.

Not by much. A simple percentage shift, the sort of thing a diagnostic graph would barely bother to show. But in the corridor itself, the bright bands along the ceiling thinned to a duller gray, as if someone had drawn a curtain over them. Shadows grew in the seams between plates. The hum of the air processors dropped half a note.

The world did not go dark.

Jonah’s body behaved as if it had.

His chest tightened, breath catching halfway down. The corridor’s straight line seemed to curve inward at the edges, walls leaning, ceiling lowering, like the ship were taking a slow, intentional breath around him.

This is nothing, he told himself. A reroute. A test.

The words fell short of the back of his skull.

Sound seemed to thicken. The usual layering—the ventilation, the distant pulse of pumps, the tiny ting of thermal expansion at joints—slid into a single, coiled tone that vibrated high behind his ears. For an instant it wasn’t ship-noise at all.

It was someone saying his name.

*Jonah.*

Not loud. Not even clear. More like the memory of a voice, dragged out thin and metallic, riding on the hum. The way his mother had said it sometimes when she was far away and trying to come back at the same time.

The hair on his arms prickled under his sleeves. His fingers tightened on the strap of his bag until the edge bit into his palm.

"Companion," he said. His throat felt dry. "Status on this corridor."

The wall node a few meters ahead brightened in answer, a calm circle of amber in the half-dim.

"Local power redistribution in progress," the AI said. "Minor fluctuation in non-critical systems. No risk to hull integrity or life support. Estimated duration: ninety seconds."

Its tone did not change. It did not say *I heard it too.*

Ninety seconds was nothing. He knew that. He could hold his breath longer than that in training drills. He had patched leaks on tighter clocks.

His lungs did not care.

Each inhale scraped. The corridor had become a throat, and he was walking down it toward some unseen mouth. The floor under his boots felt thinner, each step a question: still there? still there? still there?

He reached for the rail that ran waist-high along the wall. The metal was solid, the same cold-smooth texture it always had, worn down by generations of hands. He wrapped his fingers around it hard enough that his wrist bones ached.

"Heart rate elevated," the Companion observed after a beat. "Do you require assistance, Jonah?"

There it was—that slight tilt when it said his name. The reminder that he did not walk these corridors alone, no matter how empty they looked.

"I’m fine," he said. The lie had grooves in his mouth from years of use.

The AI did not argue. "I will remain connected," it said instead. "Seventy-eight seconds remaining."

The ship hummed.

*Jonah.*

It wasn’t a sound, not exactly. More like the suggestion of one. His brain obligingly supplied the shape of his mother’s jaw, the way it had clenched against words at the kitchen table, her voice when it finally came out flat and wrong. He smelled, impossibly, the old stew she used to burn on bad days.

You are standing in a maintenance corridor, he told himself. Your mother is nowhere near here. She is—

His thoughts hit a blank wall and slid.

The red emergency strips along the floor flickered once, a low, liquid pulse of color that made the metal look wet. His breath hitched with it.

"Fifty-nine seconds," the Companion said.

"Is this… logged?" he asked. His voice sounded distant in his own ears.

"The fluctuation is being recorded," the AI said.

"Not that." He swallowed. It hurt. "This. Me."

Another pause. He imagined data streams fanning out around him, trailing from his biometrics, his tone, the way he gripped the rail.

"Your physiological responses are within parameters observed in prior events of this type," the Companion said carefully. "If you wish to file an incident report, I can open a channel to—"

"No." The word came out too fast, too sharp. It bounced off the metal.

Silence settled again, except for the ship’s breathing.

He knew what an incident report meant. Extra eyes on his file. Questions about sleep and appetite and intrusive thoughts. Another line on the chart that had been growing quietly somewhere since he was ten and sat in a mediation room trying to explain why he watched everybody else so closely.

He stared down the corridor, into the shallower dark between one strained light and the next.

For a moment, he could not tell which tremor belonged to the ship and which came from his own muscles. He imagined looking back at this minute on a log: a trivial blip in power usage, a human heart rate trace with a meaningless spike. No one would see what he had heard. No one would know the difference between the hull’s strain and his.

"Thirty-two seconds," the Companion said.

"How many…" He stopped, reassembled the question. "How many events like this happen a day?"

"Minor power redistributions of this scale?" the AI asked. "On average, three hundred and twelve across the ship per twenty-four-hour cycle."

He let the number land.

"And how many of them feel like the ship is about to split open?" Jonah asked.

"That metric is not directly observable," the Companion said. There was no humor in it, but something about the phrasing made his lips twitch anyway. "However, historical data suggests most residents do not report significant distress during minor fluctuations."

"Most," he echoed.

"You are not 'most,'" the AI said.

He flinched.

Twenty seconds.

The hum behind his ears began to resolve back into layers: individual fans, pumps, the faint scuff of his own breath. The corridor widened by increments, as if exhaling. The light strips brightened, bleaching the red back out of the metal.

"Local redistribution complete," the Companion said. "All systems nominal."

Nominal. Normal. Words the ship used for anything it could keep moving.

Jonah unclenched his hand from the rail. The imprint of the metal pattern remained on his skin, white against the red pressure marks. His pulse was still too fast, but it had stopped trying to climb into his throat.

"Do you wish to annotate this event?" the AI asked.

He imagined the form: *Subject experienced disproportionate affective response to minor fluctuation.*

What did the models do with that? Where did they put a man who heard his mother's voice in the hum of the hull?

"No," he said. "Log the technicals. Leave me out of it."

There was that pause again.

"Acknowledged," the Companion said. "Event recorded as a routine fluctuation."

He should have been relieved. Instead, the relief tangled with something sour. The ship would remember the flicker. It would forget the way his knees had almost given.

He picked up his tool bag and started walking. His legs felt unsteady, but the floor met each step. Metal, metal, metal. Still there.

He did not look back at the wall node.

In ten minutes, he would be in a lift full of other workers, lights bright and chatter loud, the memory already softening at the edges. In a few hours, the graphs would fold this minute into a barely visible bump.

But some part of him knew, with the same cold certainty he’d felt in the dimming, that a line had been drawn here. Outside flicker, inside storm.

For the first time, he could not tell where one ended and the other began.
