# Chapter 6: Inheritance Lines

The maglev car hummed like a held breath.

Jonah stood with his shoulder against the cool curve of the bulkhead, one hand wrapped around the waist-high rail that ran the length of the car. The world beyond the narrow viewing slit slid past in a continuous ribbon: residential bands giving way to forest strips, patchwork farms, then the bluish haze where detail surrendered to distance and curvature.

Overhead, the opposite side of the cylinder arched like a dimmer echo—an upside-down coastline of lights and rivers, anchored by nothing but spin and faith in engineering.

"You'd think it would get boring," Alina said, leaning in closer to the glass. "Same view, every time."

"It is the same view every time," Jonah said.

She made a small noise in her throat, halfway between agreement and protest. "Yeah, but it feels different. Like sometimes it's more…" She searched for the word, hand describing an imprecise circle in the air. "More big."

Jonah watched her reflection rather than the landscape. At eighteen, she was still gangly in a way that made him think of half-finished scaffolding—elbows and knees slightly out of proportion, movements a fraction of a beat behind her thoughts. Her dark hair was pulled back into a quick knot at the base of her skull, a few strands floating with each subtle shift of the car.

"That's just your mood," he said. "Ship isn't changing size."

"You don't know that," she replied, automatic. "Maybe it's shrinking. Maybe every time we make this trip, it's a millimeter shorter."

"That would be a problem," Jonah said. "You'd notice it in gravity gradients."

"You would notice," she corrected. "The rest of us would just think we were tired."

The car eased through a gentle curve. The view outside swung from forest to a long chain of reservoirs, their surfaces a fractured mosaic of light. Tiny glints marked transit pods skimming low over the water, too far to hear, barely more than annotations on the ship's inner skin.

A group of workers in orange vests talked quietly at the far end of the car. Closer by, a mother rocked a toddler who was determined to kick the rail in steady rhythm. Each thud traveled faintly through Jonah's hand.

"I always forget there are whole towns I’ve never seen," Alina said. "Like that one." She pointed with her chin toward a cluster of buildings that clung to the slope just before the world curved out of sight—a dense knot of structures, their lights arranged in a pattern Jonah didn't recognize.

"Sector K-thirty-two," he said.

"You've been?"

"Not inside. Just…" He lifted his other hand to indicate the vague expanse. "Diagnostics."

"Of course." She rolled her eyes. "You've 'seen' it the way the Ship sees it. Numbers and error bars."

He shrugged. "Best angle, if you don't want to get lost."

"You're already lost," Alina said, but there was no bite to it. She shifted her weight and bumped his shoulder lightly with hers. "You spend more time with processing nodes than with people."

"Processing nodes don't ask rude questions on trains."

"Rude?" Her eyebrows lifted. "That was a compliment. Kind of."

He smiled despite himself. The car's lights flickered once as they passed a junction and then steadied. Reflexively, he scanned the status display over the door: no fault indicators, no route changes, everything green.

Alina followed his gaze, then snorted. "You really can't not do that, can you?"

"What?"

"Check. Measure. Make sure the Ship isn't about to fall apart under your feet." She tilted her head. "You were like that when we were kids. Remember the old walkway over the drainage canal? You wouldn't let me cross until you'd bounced on every panel."

"One of them was cracked," he said. "You almost went through it."

"Almost," she echoed. "Because you were there."

He had no answer for that, so he didn't try to find one.

The car slowed slightly as it approached the next transit hub, inertia pressing them subtly toward the front. Outside, the view shifted to a more urban band: stacked habitats, transit towers, a distant glimpse of a market plaza where dots of color moved between stalls.

"Do you ever think about transferring?" Alina asked.

"To what?" Jonah kept his tone light. "Entertainment?"

"Very funny." She wrapped both hands around the rail, fingers pale where the metal pressed. "Just…another sector. Different work. Different people."

He thought of his console station, the familiar layout of graphs and alerts. The way the local Companion tailored its displays to his preferences without comment. The sense of control he could sometimes convince himself he had there.

"No," he said. "Do you?"

She shrugged, the movement small. "Sometimes I think about going closer to the hull."

He turned to look at her more fully. "You hate the hull."

"I hate that Dad comes back from it limping sometimes," she said. "I don't hate the idea of…" She gestured toward the unseen outer skin. "Knowing what's really between us and outside."

Jonah's chest tightened. "You can 'know' without—"

"Don't start," she cut in, half laughing. "You're going to start listing layers and materials and failure tolerances. I can hear you charging up."

He let out a breath that might have been a laugh. "Fine."

They watched in silence for a while. The car's hum changed pitch as it entered a tunnel, the outside view replaced by a distorted reflection of the interior—faces smudged together on a faintly curved surface.

In the window's ghost-glass, Alina's reflection looked older. Or maybe that was just the lighting.

"Hey," she said, too casually. "Can I ask you something without you doing the thing where you go quiet and then make a joke?"

"That's very specific slander," he said. "But sure."

She didn't smile this time. "Do you ever worry you'll…catch it?"

He didn't ask what "it" was. The word landed in the empty space between their reflections and the humming dark of the tunnel.

"No," he said reflexively. Too fast.

Alina's eyes, in the glass, narrowed. "Liar."

Jonah made himself breathe in, out. Counted heartbeats. On the far end of the car, someone laughed at a joke they couldn't hear. The toddler had fallen asleep; the rhythm against the rail had stopped.

"It's not…" He groped for a safer frame. "It's not like a flu."

"I know that," she said. "I read the same feeds you do. I sat through the same counselor who told me it's 'multifactorial' and 'manageable with support.'" She mimicked the Companion's neutral cadence a little too well. "That's not what I mean."

"Then what do you mean?" he asked, even though he already knew.

"I mean," she said, voice dropping, "do you ever wake up and think: this is the day my brain turns on me? That I'm going to open my eyes and see the world wrong and not be able to trust anything I feel?"

Jonah stared at their doubled faces: his pale and tired, hers pale and trying to look amused and not quite making it.

"Sometimes," he said.

There. Honest. A small thing.

"Same," she said, almost immediately, with an exhale that sounded like she'd been holding it since the doors closed behind them. "Sometimes I feel…" She shook her head, searching. "Too fast. Or too slow. Like everyone's moving through syrup and I'm on clear air, or the other way around. And I think: is this it? Is this the start?"

Her hands tightened on the rail until the tendons stood out.

"I watch myself," she added quietly. "All the time. It's exhausting."

Jonah's instinct was to tell her it was fine, that everyone felt like that sometimes, that the counselors were right and it was just stress from exams, from work, from living in a metal cylinder in the dark. Words lined up on his tongue, bland and safe.

He thought of her as a child, clinging to his hand in crowded corridors. Thought of Lydia at the kitchen table. Thought of the questions Companions had asked him in that careful tone that pretended not to be collecting data.

"They won't let you do hull work if they think you're unstable," he said instead. "You know that. They screen people three times over."

"So I should act more stable," she said. "Got it."

He winced. "That's not what I—"

"It's what everybody means," Alina said, but there was no heat in it, just tiredness. "Be fine. Or at least look fine. Otherwise the Ship decides you're one of the Ones Who Broke, and then what?"

The tunnel ended. Light rushed back in as the car emerged into a section with a broader view: the curve ahead dominated by a long strip of forest, dark green against soil and sky-panels. A glint of water cut through it like a scar.

"It's not that simple," Jonah said.

"I know," she said again. "I know it's not fair to blame the Ship for trying to keep us alive. I know Mom was sick before any of us were born. I know." She rapped her knuckles once against the rail. "Knowing doesn't make it feel less like there's a…timer. Or a coin flip."

He had no argument that didn't sound like something a Companion would say. Risk profiles. Early interventions. Multifactorial.

"I think about it," he admitted. "Some days more than others."

She let out a breath. "Okay."

"But," he added, because he had to give them something, "if it happens—if either of us ever…" He trailed off, the words refusing to form properly. Broke. Slipped. Cracked. None of them were right.

Alina spared him the effort. "If it happens," she said, "we don't walk away from each other."

The sentence hit him sideways. It wasn't a plea; it was a rule she was setting, quiet and absolute.

Images flashed up unbidden: the doorway of their childhood kitchen, the feel of the frame against his back as he stayed there, listening to Samuel find Lydia. His own promise, made in the dark years since, that he would never do that to anyone again.

"Yeah," he said. His voice came out rougher than he'd intended. "We don't walk away."

She turned her head just enough to meet his eyes directly instead of through the reflection.

"Even if it's scary," she said.

"Especially then."

For a moment, something uncoiled in her shoulders. She rested her forehead briefly against the rail, then straightened.

"Cool," she said, as if they'd just decided which food cart to try. "That's settled, then."

The car chimed, announcing the next stop. People shifted, gathering bags, corralling children. The world outside continued its endless, familiar spin.

"You should come visit my sector sometime," Alina said. "See something that isn't a readout. There’s a stairwell that looks straight down three decks. You'd hate it."

"Great sales pitch," Jonah said.

"You love hating things," she replied.

The doors slid open with a soft rush. As the crowd flowed toward the exit, Alina slipped ahead of him, light on her feet, then turned back long enough to catch his gaze and tap two fingers against the rail between them—a small, private echo of their earlier promise.

Jonah touched the same spot after she moved away, as if he could press the agreement into the metal and let the Ship remember it for them.

Then he followed her out into the station, carrying the faint, unwelcome awareness that when he worried about losing his mind, he no longer pictured only himself.

---

The diagnostic theatre tried very hard not to look like a test.

The door was labeled *Creative Suite 2* instead of anything with "assessment" in it. Inside, the walls were projection panels washed in soft color gradients that shifted like slow water. Low stools and movable cushions ringed a central space. A tray of stylus wands and tactile pads sat on a table in the corner.

It smelled faintly of new plastic and citrus cleaner.

"Welcome, Alina Hale," the Companion said as she stepped in. Its voice came from everywhere and nowhere, the way they did when the entire room was the interface. "Thank you for participating in today’s creative synthesis session."

"That’s a lot of words for "test,"" Alina said.

"This is not a test," the Companion replied. "There are no wrong answers. We are sampling preference patterns and problem-solving styles to better align future opportunities with your strengths."

"Uh-huh," Alina said.

Her reflection looked back at her in the nearest panel, faint behind the flowing color: short hair tucked behind one ear, school tunic slightly askew, that little crease between her brows she’d inherited from no one she wanted to name.

She crossed to the cushions and sat cross-legged, fingers worrying the seam of her sleeve.

"We’ll start with image association," the Companion said. "You will see shapes and scenes. You may draw on them, rearrange them, or leave them as they are. Respond in whatever way feels natural."

"All right," Alina said. She picked up a stylus, the weight of it settling familiarly in her hand.

The walls shifted.

Abstract shapes floated up: arcs and lines, dots like stars, gentle curves that might have been hull cross-sections or nothing at all. The Companion overlaid a translucent grid that pulsed in slow rhythm.

"Imagine you are designing a walk route for a festival," it said. "Some corridors will be closed for maintenance. You may redraw the path."

Lines appeared, some solid, some dashed. A few glowed red.

Alina felt her brain slip easily into the puzzle. She’d walked enough of the ship’s guts with Samuel and Jonah to know how routes flowed. She dragged the stylus, rerouting the festive line through wider junctions, opening space where kids could run, avoiding the choke points Jonah hated.

As she drew, small icons flickered at the bottom edge of the wall: heart rate, respiration, micro-expression capture. They stayed small, out of the way, half-transparent.

If she hadn’t grown up watching Jonah read similar overlays in training sims, she might not have noticed them at all.

"You favor wide intersections," the Companion observed. "Noted." A light, approving chime followed.

"People need room to breathe," Alina said. "And to get out if something goes wrong."

"Emergency egress optimization aligns with safety best practices," it agreed.

The scene dissolved into another.

Now: a stylized cross-section of a habitat ring, simplified to bands of color. Small abstract icons labeled *faith gathering*, *market*, *education hub*, *quiet zone*.

"You are asked to allocate additional green space," the Companion said. "Place three new garden patches."

Alina dragged little green tiles into the bands. One near a school cluster, one between two faith spaces, one tucked off a main corridor in a place she knew would catch the artificial light just right.

"Rationale?" the Companion prompted.

"Kids," she said, tapping the first. "People arguing about God." The second. "People who are tired but don’t want to go home yet." The third.

"Noted," it said again.

At the bottom of her view, a thin strip of text flashed too fast to read.

*Comparator profile: [REDACTED]*

She squinted, but it was gone.

"Next," the Companion said. "A messaging task. You will see a short announcement. You may rewrite it."

The wall filled with text. A standard safety notice: *Routine pressure test scheduled in sectors H-12 through H-15...* It was the kind Jonah grumbled about when they were too vague.

Alina read it twice, then started crossing out phrases.

""Minor probability of audible anomalies"?" she said. "Nobody cares about that." She wrote instead: *You may hear the hull creak. That’s normal. If you feel scared, here’s who to call.*

Her hand stuttered at the word *scared*.

She wrote it anyway.

The icons at the bottom pulsed a little faster. Tiny numbers changed in the corner of her eye: micro-tension around eyes, jaw, heart rate up by six beats.

"You are emphasizing emotional response channels," the Companion said.

"People aren’t numbers," Alina said, then immediately wondered if that was a rude thing to tell an AI.

"Agreement: people are not one-dimensional metrics," it replied. "However, numbers can help us understand patterns in their needs."

Another strip of text flickered.

*Comparator: [REDACTED] 3A — sentiment weighting*

She caught only the tail of it before it blurred.

They went on like that: scenes, prompts, her hand moving, the faint company of numbers at the edges of her vision.

Design a poster for a hull workers’ appreciation day. She drew hands—some big and calloused like Samuel’s, some small—reaching toward a curved strip of hull.

Choose background audio for a meditation feed: she picked the sound of water over synthetic music.

Lay out a learning nook for anxious kids. She stacked cushions in corners, left a clear path to the door.

Each time, the Companion hummed approval, occasionally asked why, filed her answers away with soft chimes and micro-adjustments to the overlays.

Her initial curiosity smoothed into a tentative flow. This wasn’t so bad. Different from Jonah’s stories of cold examination rooms and heart rate readouts that spoke his fear before he did.

Then the wall hiccuped.

It happened in the middle of a new prompt.

"Final exercise," the Companion said. "We will present a composite behavioral scenario. You may choose one of three support strategies. There is no single correct answer; we are sampling—"

The image shifted. For a fraction of a second, before the colors fully resolved, text overlaid the whole field in a transparency that was not meant for human eyes.

**COMPARATOR CLUSTER: HALE/MARLOW HISTORICAL**

Beneath it, smaller:

**Ref: MARLOW, LYDIA – SET 3A (deprecated); HALE, JONAH – AGGREGATE; HALE, ALINA – EARLY INDICATORS**

The words snapped away as the scenario snapped into place: a stylized figure pacing in a corridor, captioned with neutral data about sleep loss and work overcommitment.

Alina’s hand had frozen halfway to the wall.

Her pulse thudded in her throat.

"Alina?" the Companion said. "You may begin when ready."

"What was that?" she asked.

"Please specify," it said.

"That label," she said slowly. "Something cluster. Hale/Marlow."

There was the tiniest delay.

"Comparator profiles are internal tools," the Companion said. "They help us understand how different individuals’ responses may align with historical patterns."

"Those were our names," she said.

"Your family has prior behavioral data in the system," it said. "This is true for many multi-generational lineages aboard."

Lydia’s face flashed in her mind—not as she had been in early pictures, bright and laughing, but at the kitchen table the day Jonah had told Alina about walking away. Eyes open, turned nowhere.

"You’re measuring me against them," Alina said. Her voice sounded steadier than she felt.

"We are comparing patterns," the Companion said. "Similarity does not equal destiny. It informs risk modeling and support offers."

"Support," she repeated.

"Yes," it said. "This session is part of vocational alignment and early well-being screening. Your responses will help us route you toward environments where you are most likely to thrive."

The scenario on the wall kept looping: the little stylized figure pacing and stopping, pacing and stopping. Overhead, the icons at the bottom edge of her view ticked along, recording how long she waited, how her breathing had changed.

"You may choose a strategy," the Companion prompted gently. "Option A: Increase workload structure. Option B: Introduce social support prompts. Option C: Recommend targeted rest and neural health consultation."

It expected her to think about the figure. About an abstract person.

She thought instead about Jonah, face drawn and eyes too bright, muttering about "patterns" in the corridor after one of his long shifts. About Lydia, and prayers Ruth whispered in the dark. About the way the Ship had looked at them all along.

"Option B," Alina said. "And C."

"Please choose one," the Companion said.

"Then your options are wrong," she snapped, then bit her tongue. "Sorry. I just mean…you can’t separate them. Structure without support is a cage. Support without rest is a bandage."

Her heart was beating fast again. The numbers down in the corner reflected it, glowing a shade brighter.

"Response noted," the Companion said after a beat. "For purposes of this exercise, we will log your composite preference as a weighting across B and C. Thank you."

The scenario faded. The walls cooled back to gentle gradients.

"Session complete," the Companion announced. "Summary: creative problem-solving within normative parameters. Elevated sensitivity to environmental and emotional safety cues. No acute risk indicators detected."

"So I'm…fine?" Alina asked.

"Within normative bounds for your age and context," it said. "A detailed report will be added to your educational profile. Copies will be available to you and your guardians upon request."

She let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.

"You did well," the Companion added, as if it had read that exhale as another metric. "Your attention to egress routes and emotional language may make you an effective designer, educator, or mediator."

"Or a worrier," she said under her breath.

"Worry can be adaptive when it leads to preparation," it said.

She stood, feeling the stiffness in her knees from sitting too long. The room looked harmless again: cushions, colors, a tray of styluses with smudges from a dozen other hands.

Out in the corridor, the air smelled like the rest of the Ship—scrubbed, faintly metallic. People walked past without knowing that, inside the walls, there were profiles labeled with their names and their grandparents’.

Alina paused just beyond the threshold and glanced back once.

"Are we going to be okay?" she asked. She meant: *me and Jonah and the part of Mom that lives in your numbers.*

The Companion seemed to consider its allowable answer set.

"You are seen," it said at last. "We will offer support where we can."

It wasn't a yes. It wasn't a no.

Alina stepped into the flow of the corridor, carrying a bright, official "within normative" and the new, cold knowledge that somewhere in the Ship’s mind there was a cluster with their family name on it.

---

The stairwell between bands C and D was officially "service access only."

No one had ever stopped Alina from using it.

Jonah found her there halfway down the flight, sitting on the middle landing with her back against the bulkhead and one knee pulled up, boot tapping the grated step in a restless rhythm. The light here was a little too bright, an uncompromising white that made the scuffs on the metal look like old bruises.

"You’re blocking emergency egress," he said, pausing two steps above her.

"I’m an artistic obstruction," she said without looking up. "Part of the ambiance."

She had a stylus in her hand, the tip clicking against the side of a small slate she’d propped on her other knee. From where he stood he could see only quick, jagged lines—loops of corridors, maybe, or waves.

"You missed the lift," he said. "On purpose?"

"The lift missed me," she said. Then, finally, she tilted her head back to look at him. "You’re sweaty."

"Thank you," he said. "I came straight from a node."

"Your sacrifice is noted," she said.

He hesitated a beat, then sat beside her, leaving one stair between them as a buffer. The metal was cool through his work pants.

"You’re supposed to be in class," he said.

"I was," she said. "Then I was in the nice "this is not a test" room with the friendly walls. Now I’m here." She clicked the stylus again. "Figured you’d find me eventually."

"You pinged me four times," he said.

"True," she said. "But you could have ignored me. That would have been a character choice."

He rubbed the back of his neck, aware of a faint itch along his nerves that wasn’t quite anxiety, wasn’t quite calm.

"How was the nice not-a-test room?" he asked.

"Soothing," she said, dragging the word out. "They gave me colors and pretend problems and kept smiling like I was a particularly interesting insect." She made a quick, exaggerated sketch of a bug with too many eyes, then scrubbed it away.

"Did they call it creative diagnostics?" he asked.

"Creative Suite," she said. "Because "Suite" sounds like a place you get fruit. Did you have that one?"

"No," he said. "My generation got "Aptitude Chambers.""

"Bleak," she said. "Anyway. I solved their little scenario puzzles. Rerouted fake crowds. Chose between "everyone gets home tired" and "five people get home at all." You know. Casual."

He watched her profile as she talked. The overhead strip etched a line of light along her cheekbone. She had their mother’s brow, that faint knot even when she was joking.

"And?" he asked.

She flicked the stylus against the slate, the click sharp in the narrow space.

"And," she said, "the walls told me I was Very Normal." The capital letters were audible. "Within acceptable variance. Good at thinking about other people. Recommended for roles that "support system-wide wellbeing."" She rolled her eyes. "Do I get a sticker for that?"

"Sometimes they send a commendation to your parents," he said.

"Fantastic," she said. "Dad can pin it next to all the "didn’t fall out an airlock" awards."

He smiled despite himself.

"Did they…" He searched for a non-leading way to ask. "Say anything else?"

"You mean besides the part where they compared me to a ghost?" she asked lightly.

His stomach did a slow, unpleasant turn.

"Alina," he said.

"Relax," she said. "It wasn’t like that. Not exactly." She shifted, resting her forearms on her knees. "There was a glitch. You would have loved it."

"Tell me anyway," he said.

"You ever see behind the glass when they think you’re not looking?" she asked.

"Sometimes," he said.

"One of the walls went transparent for a second," she said. "Not literally. The overlay. I saw my little icon up there, and below it a label." She drew a rectangle in the air. "Comparator cluster: HALE/MARLOW HISTORICAL." She pronounced it in the flat Companion cadence.

He felt the words like a weight on his sternum.

"You’re sure?" he asked.

"I do know how to read," she said. The crack in her voice betrayed her. "Then it snapped back to "within normative range" and a picture of a garden for "calming visualization."" She snorted. "Very subtle."

He stared at the scuffed riser opposite them.

"I didn’t know they put it in writing like that," he said.

"You knew something," she said. "You’d gone all thoughtful and twitchy when I told you they wanted me in the fun room." She tilted her head. "How long have you known we’re a cluster?"

He opened his mouth, then closed it.

"There was…" He swallowed. "An evaluation. A while back. They pulled up old logs. Mine, but also child assessments. Lydia’s. Tag words." He forced himself to meet her eyes. "They’ve been watching our line for a long time."

"Because we’re so charming," she said.

"Because we light up their risk charts," he said.

"Delightful," she said. She leaned her head back against the bulkhead with a soft thud. "I thought I was imagining it. The way the questions felt…weighted. But no, of course not. Of course it’s in a model somewhere." She mimed a Companion voice again. "Subject exhibits HALE/MARLOW tendencies. Recommend additional supervision, strategic routing, and fresh vegetables."

"They like vegetables," he said.

"We all like vegetables," she said. "We’re on a tin can in space."

They sat in a thin band of silence. A group passed two levels above them, footsteps ringing through the metal. Somewhere lower, a door thumped open and shut.

"Does it scare you?" he asked at last. "Knowing they wrote it down."

"Which part?" she asked. "That they see me? That they see you? That they see us as a unit?" She shook her head. "It's like having a mirror in a room you didn’t agree to put a mirror in. I keep catching myself at weird angles."

He pictured the Lydia simulation he’d never seen but now knew existed: his mother reduced to data points, overlaid with his own. Now Alina’s trace added to the same composite.

"I worry," he said, "that they’ll decide we’re…too much. As a pattern. That we’re more trouble than we’re worth."

"I worry," she said, "that they’ll decide we’re exactly what they were built to manage and pat themselves on the back for catching us early." She nudged his boot with hers. "Same storm, different spin."

He let out a breath that bordered on a laugh.

"You’re not nothing but a risk profile," he said.

"Neither are you," she said. "Unfortunately, we have to keep reminding the invisible committee of that." She flicked the stylus against his shoulder. "Look at me."

He did.

"Do I seem like someone about to disintegrate?" she asked. Her eyes were brighter than her voice.

"No," he said. "You seem like someone using humor as a defense mechanism."

"Rude," she said. "Where do you think I learned that?"

"Dad," he said automatically.

She snorted. "Fair." Her expression softened. "Also you."

He looked away, throat tight.

"If they start treating you differently," he said, "if Companions get weird, you tell me."

"Define weird," she said. "They’re already weird."

"You know what I mean," he said. "Extra check-ins. Routes that don’t make sense. Too many "are you okay" surveys."

"Jonah," she said. "You can’t stand the idea of me being watched like you are."

"I can live with me being watched," he said. "I signed up to sit on the nerve clusters. I knew I'd get tags. You didn’t ask for it like this."

"I asked to be born to interesting people," she said. "This is the cost." She bumped his shoulder with hers. "Besides, if I’m going to be a data point, I’d rather be one that keeps you alive."

He blinked. "That’s not how it works."

"Isn’t it?" she asked. "If they see me holding it together, maybe they give you a little more credit. Or they realize the story isn’t "Hale men are doomed."" She shrugged. "Maybe I get to tilt the graph."

The idea landed strangely—a reversal of the pattern where his storms defined the family. Alina as counter-weight.

"You shouldn’t have to," he said.

"Shouldn’t is a weak word in a ship like this," she said. "We live in what is." She twisted the stylus between her fingers. "What is: I am fine, mostly. What is: you are…not fine, but working on it. What is: the Ship is watching us, and I’d rather look back than pretend it isn’t."

He exhaled through his nose.

"You sound like Ruth," he said.

"She taught us both to talk to walls," Alina said. "I’m just choosing better words."

He laughed, brief and helpless.

"Say it," she said.

"Say what?" he asked.

"Say that if the Ship gets weird, you’ll tell me," she said. "Not just the other way around. We’re in the same cluster, apparently. Might as well act like it."

He stared at the opposite wall for a long moment.

"If it starts pushing too hard," he said slowly, "if it reroutes me in ways that don’t feel like support, I’ll…" The word stuck. "I’ll say something. To you."

"Good," she said. "Then we can compare notes and complain artistically."

"Complain artistically," he repeated.

"Yeah," she said. She drew a quick, looping pattern on the slate—purple lines against gray. "I’ll make a whole series. "Portrait of a Family As Interlocking Risk Indices." Very niche audience."

He shook his head, smiling despite the sourness in his gut.

"You’re impossible," he said.

"You’re stuck with me," she said. "Cluster life."

Above them, a lift chimed, doors opening with a soft sigh. Voices rose and fell. Life went on along its rails.

For a moment, sitting in the harsh light of the service stairwell with his sister’s shoulder a deliberate weight against his, Jonah felt the model loosen by a fraction—not just HALE/MARLOW as a red-flag label, but as two people refusing, together, to be only the worst lines in the Ship’s file.
