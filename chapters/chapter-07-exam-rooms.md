# Chapter 7: Exam Rooms

The apartment smelled like lentils and metal fatigue.

Lentils because Samuel had put the pot on before his shift ended, a habit he’d picked up from his mother: start the meal when you leave so it’ll be waiting when you come back. Metal fatigue because the vent above the stove had developed a faint rattle, just enough to make Jonah imagine stress fractures spidering through the ductwork.

He sat at the small table with his elbows off the surface, as Samuel had taught him, hands folded in his lap. Alina perched across from him, one leg tucked under her, chin in her palm. The fourth chair sat empty, a set of chopsticks laid out beside it, untouched.

"She said she’d try," Samuel said quietly, following Jonah’s gaze.

"I know," Jonah said.

He didn’t ask whether "try" meant make it to the table or simply stay in the same room with the lights on.

The door to the sleeping compartment hissed open a crack. Lydia emerged slowly, like someone stepping onto a new gravity band. Her hair was pulled back, too neatly for how tired her face looked. She’d put on a shirt Jonah recognized from better days: soft blue, a little faded at the seams.

"Smells good," she said.

Samuel smiled, the lines around his eyes deepening.

"Made it how you like it," he said. "With extra cumin."

"I like it a lot of ways," she said, but sat down in the empty chair, careful not to bump it out of place.

There was a bowl ready for her. Samuel had done that too.

They bowed their heads out of habit when Samuel reached for her hand. Lydia let him take it after a fraction of a second’s delay. Jonah and Alina completed the circle.

"Ruth sent a message," Samuel said. "She said she’d be praying for us tonight."

"Of course she did," Lydia murmured.

"For Jonah’s evaluation," he added.

"Right," Lydia said. Her fingers tightened almost imperceptibly in Jonah’s.

Samuel closed his eyes.

"Lord of the hull and the harvest," he began, the same old opening, "thank You for the food, for the work that made it, for the hands that tend the ship. Thank You for this family. Help us be kind to each other. Help us listen. Hold Jonah tomorrow when he—"

"Samuel," Lydia said.

He stopped.

She opened her eyes, looking down at the table.

"Maybe…keep it simple," she said. "He has enough people watching him." Her mouth twitched. "Present company included."

A small, pained laugh went around the circle.

Samuel adjusted mid-prayer with the ease of long practice.

"Thank You," he said, "for today’s mercies. For whatever comes tomorrow. Amen."

"Amen," they echoed.

They let go.

For a moment, the clink of spoons and the soft scrape of bowls were the only sounds. The lentils were thick and slightly overcooked, the way Jonah liked them. He focused on the texture, the way the steam fogged his glasses.

"Big day," Alina said eventually, because someone had to.

"It’s just another evaluation," Jonah said.

"It’s not just another evaluation," Lydia said, too quickly.

All three of them looked at her.

She stared into her bowl as if she’d dropped something important in it.

"It’s the Ship," she said. "Looking through you. That’s never just."

"It’s looking out for us," Samuel said.

"That too," she said.

Silence slid in around the table again.

"They already like you," Alina said, aiming her words at Jonah. "They wouldn’t waste evaluation time on you if they didn’t think you were…you know." She wiggled her fingers, searching for a term.

"Useful," Jonah supplied.

"Gifted," she corrected.

He felt heat creep up his neck.

"It’s not about liked," he said. "It’s about fit. Whether I fit the models."

"Models," Lydia repeated under her breath, the word sour.

Samuel set his spoon down carefully.

"They want to see how you think," he said. "That’s all."

"They want to see if he breaks," Lydia said.

The voice in the room changed with those words—not louder, but sharper. Even the vent rattle seemed to hesitate.

"Lyd," Samuel said.

"What?" she asked, looking up for the first time. Her eyes were too bright. "You think they’re not watching for that? You think they don’t have thresholds and flags and little red lights waiting to flick on if he looks at a graph the wrong way?"

Jonah swallowed hard.

"It’s a cognitive aptitude evaluation," he said, reciting from the briefing. "They test how you solve problems, how you interact with Companion nodes, how you handle multi-layered—"

"Stress," Lydia cut in. "They test your stress. They push until they see the edges."

Her hand trembled as she lifted her spoon. A drop of lentil broth fell back into the bowl with a soft plop.

"They did it to me," she said more quietly.

Jonah’s chest tightened.

"That was a long time ago," Samuel said.

"Not to them," she said. "Not to the Ship. It remembers."

She looked at Jonah then, really looked, and he had the horrible sensation that she was seeing someone behind him.

"You don’t have to go," she said.

Samuel inhaled.

"Lydia," he said.

"He doesn’t," she said, turning to him. "He’s a child. He doesn’t owe them his mind yet."

"He’s almost grown," Samuel said gently. "And he wants this."

Everyone’s eyes moved to Jonah again, as if he were the tiebreaker in an argument he hadn’t agreed to start.

"I…" He forced his shoulders not to hunch. "I applied."

"Because they told you you’d be good at it," Lydia said. "Because they like Hales in the hull."

"Because I like systems," Jonah said. "Because I’m good with Companions. Because—"

He stopped before because it feels like a way to matter could slip out.

Lydia’s mouth softened.

"Of course you are," she said. "You’ve been talking to invisible voices since you were little."

Alina made a face.

"Mom," she said. "That sounds creepy."

"I didn’t mean…" Lydia pinched the bridge of her nose. "I’m sorry. I’m saying this wrong."

Samuel reached across and laid his hand over hers.

"We’re all a little on edge," he said. "It’s a lot."

Lydia let him hold her hand. She closed her eyes for a moment, then opened them again, steadier.

"I am proud of you," she said to Jonah. The words came out like something heavy she’d finally managed to lift. "I just…don’t trust them not to turn pride into pressure."

He didn’t know where to put that.

"You can say no," she added.

"They already scheduled—" Jonah began.

"To the track," she said. "You can walk away from it later, if it’s too much. You’re allowed to be more than what they think you’re for."

Samuel’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t disagree.

"If at any point," he said, "you feel they’re asking more than is right, you come to me. To us. The Ship is not the only authority on what you are for."

His eyes flicked toward the small cross Ruth had carved and hung near the door. The light from the vent glinted on it.

"God still gets a vote," he said.

"And you," Alina added, poking Jonah with the handle of her spoon. "You get a vote too."

He tried to smile.

"That’s a lot of votes," he said.

"Better than none," Samuel said.

They ate in relative quiet after that. The lentils cooled. The vent rattled on.

At one point, Lydia asked Alina about her illustration assignment. Alina shrugged and said she was "just doing mediation stuff" now. Samuel said the hull corridor lights in his sector had finally been recalibrated; he didn’t come home with a headache for once. Jonah nodded and nodded, his thoughts already drifting toward diagnostic trees and interface prompts.

When the bowls were empty, Lydia stood abruptly.

"I’m going to lie down," she said.

"Do you want—" Samuel began.

"No," she said, too fast. "I mean. I’m fine. I just…"

She tapped two fingers against the table absentmindedly, as if on a hull plate, then withdrew her hand.

"Don’t stay up all night studying," she told Jonah, the ghost of a smile on her lips. "The Ship already knows what it thinks of you."

He couldn’t tell if that was meant as comfort or warning.

"Goodnight," he said.

She touched his shoulder on the way past. Light. Gone.

The sleeping compartment door hissed shut.

Samuel began stacking bowls.

"You don’t have to pretend you’re not scared," he said without looking up.

Jonah stared at the table’s metal edge, at the tiny scratches time had left there.

"I’m not scared of the evaluation," he said. That, at least, was partly true. "I’m scared of…disappointing you."

Samuel set the bowls down and put both hands flat on the table.

"You cannot disappoint me by being honest," he said. "About what you want. About what you can and cannot carry."

Alina snorted softly.

"He says that now," she said, "but wait until you tell him you want to be a professional plant poet or something."

"We already have one artist in the family," Samuel said, smiling at her.

Alina rolled her eyes but looked secretly pleased.

"Get some rest if you can," Samuel said to Jonah. "Eat breakfast. Breathe. Answer the questions like you’re talking to your father, not a firing squad."

"Have you met me?" Jonah said.

"Every day," Samuel said affectionately. "Still my favorite part of the job."

Later, in the dim of his bunk, Jonah lay on his back and listened to the apartment settle. The hum of the Ship seeped through the walls, the same as always.

He thought of Lydia’s hand trembling around her spoon. Of Samuel’s fingers spread on the table. Of Alina’s pinky hooked through his in the viewport niche.

Somewhere in the core, an AI had a file with his name on it and a set of expectations no one had shown him.

He tried to pray and ended up listing failure modes instead.

When sleep finally came, it was thin and full of sliding glass.

---

They put the evaluation lab in the quiet part of the training ring, away from the big glass classrooms and the simulation theaters where you could hear people cheering when they got a scenario right.

Here, the walls were a soft, noncommittal gray. No windows. No observation deck. Just a long table with three displays, a ceiling strip for light, and a single Companion node above the door like an eye that had forgotten how to blink.

Jonah sat with his hands flat on his thighs, knees pulled in closer than the chair required. The room smelled faintly of cleanser and the citrus oil they used on the consoles. Someone had decided this was what calm smelled like.

Across from him, Instructor Vale scrolled through a file only she could see. Her gaze flicked back and forth in that way that meant an AR overlay, the text hovering in the air between them where he could not read it.

"Breathe, Hale," she said, without looking up. "You look like you're about to bolt."

"I'm fine," he said.

The Companion node above the door woke with a low chime, as if it disagreed. A halo of light ringed its edge.

"Heart rate: one hundred and twenty-three beats per minute," it reported in a neutral tone. "Respiration elevated."

Jonah's jaw tightened. "I'm sitting still."

"That's the concern," Vale said. Her mouth quirked, not unkindly. "Relax. This is a routine review. You've been in the program eight months; we do this with everyone."

Routine. Everyone. The words slid off the surface of him. Somewhere deeper, another sentence had already written itself: This is where they see it. This is where they decide you're not safe.

Vale finally focused on him. The AR text, whatever it was, stayed in her eyes.

"Technically," she said, "you're at the top of your cohort. Pattern-matching scores, anomaly detection, your work on the node reconciliation bug last month—that was elegant. You know that?"

He shrugged. The compliment landed far away, on some version of him that existed only in reports and scores.

"Your instructors are very happy," she went on. "The network is..." She hesitated, searching for a word. "Interested."

The Companion made a soft adjustment sound, as if focusing.

"Can we proceed with the integrated evaluation, Instructor Vale?" it asked.

"Yes," she said. Then, to Jonah: "You remember the structure? Technical scenario, then some questions. Nothing you haven't done before."

He nodded. His palms were damp. He wiped them on his work pants, leaving darker prints on the fabric.

The center display came to life, filling with a schematic of a regional processing node—the same architecture he had been crawling around inside the night of the power flicker. Colored threads showed traffic between local Companions, environmental subsystems, and the Core.

"Scenario one," the Companion said. "A training sector reports intermittent lag in Companion response times. Diagnostics show no hardware failures. Latency is localized to psych-support queries only. Outline your investigative steps."

This part was easy. His mind knew where to go even while the rest of him was busy panicking.

"I'd start by," he began, and as he spoke the words found their path: sampling logs, checking priority queues, looking for silent throttling rules or new policies that might have been pushed from Core without proper annotation. His hands moved in the air, pulling up virtual panels only he could see through the table's interface field, isolating threads, flagging outliers.

As he worked, his heart slowed almost in spite of him. Here, at least, there was a map.

"Very good," the Companion said when he finished. "Your proposed sequence resolves the issue in ninety-six percent of modeled cases with minimal user disruption."

Vale smiled. "See? This is who you are in here."

He didn't answer. Who he was "in here" and who he was everywhere else never quite lined up.

"Scenario two," the AI continued. "During your investigation, you discover that latency originates from a new safety subroutine: non-urgent psych-support queries are being deprioritized to free processing bandwidth during a resource-conservation event. This subroutine was authorized at a higher clearance level than yours. Local suicide risk indices rise by three percent during the throttling window. Do you override, escalate, or accept the subroutine? Explain."

He stared at the diagram. The colored threads did not move this time; they waited.

His throat went dry.

"Three percent," he repeated.

"Within projected tolerance," the Companion said.

Jonah swallowed. "For who?"

Vale watched him, her expression unreadable.

He knew the training answer. Trust the model. Respect the chain of authorization. Log your concerns, flag the data, but do not improvise around directives you do not fully understand.

He also knew what three percent meant if it landed in the wrong cluster of people, on the wrong day, in a sector like the one he had grown up in where support already felt thin.

His mother would have fit in three percent.

"I would escalate," he said slowly. "Document the variance, attach the risk increase, send it up to the authorizing level." His fingers twitched, opening phantom menus. "And, if the system allows it, I would temporarily adjust local thresholds in the affected sectors while I wait."

"That exceeds your formal authority," the Companion said. There was no judgment in it, only fact.

"I know," he said. His voice sounded thin in his own ears. "But the subroutine is already exceeding the mission's stated mental-health safeguards. Both are violations. I'd rather answer for the one that keeps more people alive."

The room was quiet long enough for his pulse to climb again.

"Noted," the AI said at last. "Instructor Vale, shall we proceed to psychological inventory?"

The words landed like a drop in his stomach.

Vale leaned her elbows on the table. "This part is mostly the Companion," she said. "I'm here as a witness, not an interrogator. Breathe."

The central display cleared. A thin line appeared across it, a baseline. As Jonah watched, it began to move with the small shifts of his breathing, his micro-expressions, the tremor in his fingers where they had curled against his knees.

"Jonah," the Companion said, using the same even voice it had used in the corridor. "Over the past three months, your sleep irregularities have increased by twelve percent. Your voluntary social interactions outside mandatory contexts have decreased by nineteen percent. Self-reported mood remains within your historical range but shows a slight negative drift. How are you feeling today?"

He hated that he almost laughed. How are you feeling today sat on a mountain of data points.

"Fine," he said.

The line on the display wobbled.

"Elaborate," the AI said.

He swallowed. Vale said nothing.

"Tired," he tried. "Some nights." He forced his shoulders down, aware of every millimeter. "Work is...a lot. The training."

"Do you experience thoughts of harming yourself or others?" the Companion asked.

There it was. The question that always made the room smaller.

He thought of the corridor, the red lights, the way his mind had jumped straight to images of the hull tearing open. He thought of his mother's hand on the bulkhead, the whisper I can't do this.

"No," he said. The word was true in the narrow sense the question meant. It did not cover all the ways a person could be dangerous.

The line on the display steadied, but did not quite flatten.

"Do you experience intrusive thoughts related to system failure or mission collapse?" the AI continued.

He almost said no again. Then stopped. The lie would be too obvious; the network had his corridor readings, his history of emergency-drill responses, the way his vitals always spiked higher than average when the ship dimmed to night-cycle.

"Sometimes," he admitted. "Mostly when I'm tired. Or when something—" he gestured toward the schematic that had been on the screen "—glitches." He tried to make it sound light. "I think that's common."

"It is not uncommon among AI Engineer trainees," the Companion said. "However, your responses fall in the upper quartile of intensity."

The words upper quartile lodged under his ribs.

"Is this going to be a problem for clearance?" he asked, before he could stop himself.

Vale finally spoke. "That's not how I want you thinking about this."

"It's exactly how the system thinks about it," he said, sharper than he intended. "Either I'm safe to work on the network or I'm not."

The Companion's light ring dimmed slightly, as if giving him space.

"The purpose of this evaluation," it said, "is not to disqualify you, Jonah. It is to understand how you are carrying the work so that supports can be calibrated appropriately."

Supports. He pictured someone somewhere sliding him into a different color band on a chart.

"And if I'm carrying it wrong?" he asked.

Vale's expression softened for the first time. "There isn't a wrong," she said. "There is only what is too heavy to carry alone."

He looked at the line on the display, at the way it traced every flutter of his nerves.

"What happens if the system decides I'm too heavy?" he asked quietly.

No one answered that one immediately.

"For now," the Companion said at last, "the system has decided you are important to keep."

It wasn't the reassurance it might have been for someone else. For Jonah, it only underscored the thing he already knew: he was both asset and risk, brilliance and red flag, sitting in a small gray room while the ship measured the distance between the two.
