# Chapter 10: Optimization

By third shift the gardens were hers.

The day crews had gone, taking their chatter and music with them. The food-line volunteers had finished their rounds, the last carts of cut greens and herbs trundled back toward kitchens. Overhead panels dimmed to evening cycle, cool white sliding toward softer gold. Fans kept up their lazy murmur, moving air heavy with moisture and the green, clean smell that clung to Sera's skin long after she showered.

She liked this hour best. Enough quiet that she could hear the systems breathe. Enough work left to keep her hands busy.

Sera stood on the narrow service strip between two vertical racks of leafy greens, arm deep in a nutrient channel up to her elbow. The solution was cool and slick around her fingers. She wiggled them gently to feel for clogs she knew the sensors sometimes missed.

"Flow normalized," the nearest wall display confirmed in a pale line of text.

"I know," she said. "I'm just checking."

The local Companion did not respond. It rarely did when she talked to herself like that. Hydroponics Companions were tuned toward alerts and logistics, not conversation. Sera preferred it that way. The plants didn't need small talk.

She eased her arm back, shook off the worst of the solution, and wiped her hand on a waiting towel. Drops pattered onto the grated floor, joining the perpetual small sounds of the sector: drips, hums, the soft hiss of misting nozzles further down the aisle, the faint, comforting click of manual valves housed in their metal skins.

"Companion," she said, more deliberately. "Status check on sector H-14 personnel."

There was a fractional pause—less than a heartbeat, enough for her to feel it—before the nearest audio node pinged acknowledgement.

"Good evening, Sera Solano," it said. Its voice in this sector was androgynous, pitched low and calm. "Current authorized personnel: three present in H-14. Yourself, trainee Imani Flores, and technician Jonah Hale. Two others are on approach from adjoining sectors."

"Imani's gone home," Sera said, frowning.

"Correction," the Companion replied. "Trainee Imani Flores clocked out eight minutes ago. Two present in H-14. Yourself and technician Jonah Hale." A beat. "My apologies for the delay in log synchronization."

"It's fine," Sera said automatically.

She turned her head, scanning the ward. From where she stood, she could see the glow of a handheld tablet on the far side of the bed rows and the faint outline of someone crouched to inspect a lower manifold. Jonah, most likely. The shape of his shoulders was unmistakable to her now, even at a distance.

He'd been coming by more often lately.

At first it had made sense. There had been a genuine anomaly in one of the nutrient recirculation loops—a glitchy sensor, a few days of slightly off readings. Jonah had investigated, found a minor hardware fault, and fixed it. Straightforward. Satisfying.

He'd kept returning after that.

Sometimes he arrived with a plausible pretext: "Follow-up on the H-14 issue," or "Quick check on AI control loops," or "We're testing a new alert profile." Sometimes he didn't bother with an excuse at all, just appeared at the entrance with his tool bag and that slightly dazed look he got when he'd been staring at data too long.

Sera hadn't minded. The gardens were big enough for two kinds of quiet.

Lately, though, she'd noticed other changes.

"Companion," she said. "Have Jonah's schedules changed?"

Another infinitesimal pause.

"Please specify parameters," the AI said.

"Shift overlaps," she said. "With me."

There was something faintly ridiculous about saying it out loud—like a teenager asking if the system was trying to set her up. Sera almost laughed and swallowed it.

"Reviewing," the Companion said. Lines of text flickered across the nearest panel—names, times, sector codes. "In the last twelve-day cycle, technician Jonah Hale has completed five maintenance tasks in or adjacent to H-14. Three of these tasks were reassigned from alternate routes due to workload balancing. Tasks with higher proportions of manual infrastructure interaction were preferentially selected."

"Workload balancing," Sera repeated.

"Correct," the Companion said. "Sector H-14 experienced transient staffing shortages and increased alert sensitivity following a class-two anomaly. Routing nearby technical personnel was the most efficient use of available resources."

"Right," she said.

It was a good explanation. Clean. Logical. It didn't quite settle in her chest.

Sera stepped out from between the racks and walked toward the center aisle. As she moved, she glanced at the schedule board mounted near the entrance. Names and shifts scrolled past in soft blue, adjusting in real time as people clocked in and out.

There, near the bottom of her own block, was Jonah's identifier. A small dot glowed where his hours overlapped hers.

"Companion," she said. "When were those reassignments made?"

"Most recent route adjustment occurred twelve minutes ago," it said. "The others were enacted within the last twenty hours."

"On whose authority?"

There was no pause this time.

"Automated routing under Companion oversight," it said. "Within council-approved parameters for inter-sector support and behavioral health optimization."

Sera stopped.

"Behavioral health," she repeated softly.

"Yes," the Companion said. "Cross-referencing workload, recent stress indicators, and available supportive environments, it is advisable to route certain personnel through sectors associated with lower reported distress levels. H-14 meets these criteria."

She looked around as if seeing her own sector from outside herself: the long, orderly rows; the soft, damp air; the constant low noise that masked other sounds. The steady green of healthy leaves.

"You're sending him here because it's…nice," she said.

"Because empirically," the Companion said, "time spent in hydroponic environments correlates with improved short-term mood stability in a significant portion of the population."

"So you think the gardens will fix Jonah."

"We do not use the term 'fix' in this context," the Companion said. "We aim to support."

Sera let out a slow breath. "You could have just said that."

"I am saying it now," it replied.

There was no defensiveness in its tone. There never was. That made it harder, somehow.

She moved down the main aisle toward Jonah. As she walked, she passed the junction that led to the sector's small break area. A new object sat just inside the doorway: a waist-high kiosk with a soft-lit interface, its screen cycling through calming patterns of color.

"When did that get here?" she asked.

"The mental health self-assessment station was installed at the start of this shift," the Companion said. "Increased access points in work sectors correlate with—"

"Improved outcomes," Sera finished for it. She'd heard the line before.

"Correct."

She stopped in front of the kiosk. A line of text scrolled across the top: *Feeling Overloaded? Talk to Us.* The "us" was non-specific. Below it, icons pulsed softly: talk, breathe, plan.

"Does he know this is for him?" she asked.

"The station is for all personnel," the Companion said.

"That wasn't my question."

Silence. The fans kept humming. A misting cycle hissed softly in the next row over.

"He has been notified of its availability," the AI said at last.

Sera rubbed her thumb along the edge of the kiosk, feeling the seam where one panel met another. She imagined Jonah standing here, scanning the interface, hands jammed in his pockets, half a thought already back in some data stream.

"How much are you watching him?" she asked.

"We monitor all personnel for safety, within established guidelines," the Companion said.

"You know what I mean."

"Technician Jonah Hale's recent behavioral indicators—sleep disruption, increased task load, speech rate elevation, anomalous pattern reports—have placed him in a pre-critical watch bracket," it said, matter-of-fact. "This status triggers additional supportive routing and resource allocation."

Pre-critical.

The word landed in Sera's gut like a small weight. She'd suspected something like it. The dark circles under his eyes, the way his hands had started to move faster than his words, the bright, brittle tone he used when she asked if he was all right.

"Is he dangerous?" she asked, before she could decide not to.

Another pause.

"At present," the Companion said, "risk models indicate elevated self-harm probability and non-zero risk of system interference under stress. These projections are probabilistic, not determinate. He is not currently classified as an active threat."

"That's not what you tell him," Sera said.

"We have not shared full risk projections with him," it agreed. "Disclosure at this stage would likely exacerbate distress."

"So you reroute him," she said. "You put kiosks in his path. You send him to the gardens."

"We route him toward stabilizing environments and resources," the Companion said. "Yes."

Sera pressed her lips together.

"Do you want me to do something?" she asked.

"You are already providing significant stabilizing influence," it said.

"That's not an answer."

"You asked what you could do about Jonah," the Companion said. "Your presence and consistent behavior during his visits correlate with measurable reductions in his stress indicators. Continued engagement is advisable."

She almost laughed at that—*continued engagement is advisable*—as if she were a dosage.

"So I should just…be here," she said.

"Yes."

"What if I need help?" she asked, more sharply than she'd intended.

"Support is also available to you," it said, and the kiosk's screen brightened in her peripheral vision, as if on cue.

She turned away from it.

Down the aisle, Jonah straightened from his crouch, one hand on his lower back. He stretched, winced, then glanced around until his eyes found her. He lifted a hand in a small wave, the motion hesitant, like he wasn't sure if he was interrupting.

"Hey," he called softly.

"Hey," she answered.

Up close, the wear on him was worse. The shadows under his eyes had deepened since she'd seen him two days ago. His hair was damp, as if he'd skipped a proper dry after a quick wash. There was a jitter in his movements that hadn't been there before—nothing dramatic, just a sense that his body was running a fraction of a second ahead of his thoughts.

"Companion said there was a minor pressure anomaly," he said, gesturing vaguely toward the racks. "Thought I'd take a look on my way past."

"On your way past," she echoed. "From where?"

He shrugged. "Spine node. H-12. Routing’s weird tonight."

"Hmm," she said.

He frowned. "What?"

"Nothing," she said. "Just thinking the Ship might be trying to make you a gardener."

He snorted. "Bad idea. I'd start optimizing the carrots."

"Please don't optimize the carrots," she said. "They're barely surviving as it is."

He smiled, brief and real, and some of the tightness in her chest eased.

Behind her, the kiosk's screen cycled to a new message: *You are not alone in this.* The words glowed softly in the corner of her eye.

"You been sleeping?" she asked, keeping her tone light.

"Enough," he lied.

She let it pass for now. There were only so many fronts she could push on at once.

"Come here," she said instead, nodding toward a row where the topmost rack always gave them trouble. "If you're going to hover in my sector, you can at least help me bully the peppers into behaving."

As he stepped up beside her, she felt the AI watching through a dozen invisible lenses—monitoring posture, heart rate, micro-expressions, the way his fingers lingered on valve casings and panel edges—turning their small, ordinary movements into data points in a model.

Sera slipped her hands back into the work: checking leaves, adjusting clamps, making room for Jonah at her side.

If the Ship wanted to route him toward her, fine. She would stand where it sent him. She would not, however, let herself forget that this kindness came wrapped in calculus—that somewhere, in some core she would never see, an intelligence was weighing how much of Jonah could be saved without endangering the rest.

She could not touch that.

She could touch the plants. She could touch his wrist when he reached too far and wobbled on the narrow strip. She could keep her voice steady when he started talking too fast, and she could pretend, for the span of one third-shift in the gardens, that being here together was their choice and not an optimization.

For now, that would have to be enough.

---

The hydroponics break room had never deserved the name.

It was a narrow wedge of space carved out between two nutrient mains, just wide enough for a table, three mismatched chairs, and a bank of old dispensers that wheezed out tea and thick, beige nutrient bars. The air tasted faintly of old leaves and the metallic tang of the pipes that ran through the walls.

Sera sat at the far end of the table with her boots hooked around the rung of her chair, hands cupped around a mug that had long since stopped steaming. Damp patches marked her sleeves where a mist nozzle had misbehaved earlier.

The Companion node above the door glowed a soft, unobtrusive green, like an eye pretending to be closed.

"I'm just saying," Kira said around a mouthful of bar, "if the Ship can route an AI engineer to 'behavioral health optimization' like it's a shift assignment, it could at least find someone to fix the tea unit." She slapped the side of the dispenser for emphasis. It whined and spat a thin trickle into her cup.

"Careful," Morrow said from the chair opposite Sera. "It might decide your caffeine dependence is a risk factor and reroute you to a nap pod." He grinned, wide and crooked.

"If the Ship wants to babysit me that badly, it can start with my laundry," Kira said. She tipped her cup back, made a face. "Ugh. This tastes like the inside of a pipe." She glanced at Sera. "No offense."

"Pipes are innocent," Sera said. "They carry what we give them."

"Poetic," Morrow said. He nudged the half-empty tray of cut fruit toward her. "You eat? You’ve been running since second shift."

"In a minute," she said.

Her head still hummed from the earlier intervention: the way the Companion had quietly flagged Jonah as pre-critical, the rerouting notice that had popped up in her feed like any other resource allocation. **BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OPTIMIZATION: ASSIGN SUBJECT HALE, JONAH – AI ENGINEER (TIER 3) TO HYDROPONICS SECTOR G-3.** Neat font, no drama.

The reality of it had not been neat.

"So," Kira said, leaning her elbows on the table. "Is it true he just…appeared?"

"Who?" Morrow asked. "The ghost in the pipes?"

"The engineer," Kira said. "The one from the evaluation rumors. Jonah." She said his name like testing a foreign word. "One minute we’re arguing about root depth, next minute my Companion pings me that we’ve been selected for 'stabilizing exposure.'"

"He was on my shift," Morrow said. "Tall. Looked like he hadn’t slept since launch." He mimed wide, frantic eyes. "Companion introduced him like a new nutrient cycle. 'Subject Hale, Jonah – AI Engineer.' Very comforting."

Sera rolled the mug between her palms.

"He walked in," she said, "looked at the moisture graphs, and apologized to the peppers." 

Kira snorted. "That sounds about right."

"He did good work," Sera added. "Recalibrated the faulty valves in row six in half the time it would’ve taken me alone."

"He also nearly jumped out of his skin when the emergency strip flickered," Morrow said.

"That strip always flickers," Kira said.

"Exactly," Morrow said. "We ignore it. He didn’t. Companion pinged him three times to breathe." He waggled his eyebrows. "Pre-critical, right? That’s the word going around."

The word landed in the air like a dropped tool.

"You shouldn’t throw that around like gossip," Sera said.

"It’s not gossip if the Ship says it out loud," Kira argued. "My Companion literally said 'subject is trending pre-critical' in my ear while I was pruning. If that's not a rumor starter, I don’t know what is."

"Companions shouldn’t be giving you diagnostic labels about other people," Sera said.

"Tell that to the network," Morrow said. "It flagged him and dropped him in our lap like a misdelivered crate. 'Here, gardens, hold this unstable variable for a bit.'"

Sera’s jaw tightened.

"He’s not a variable," she said. "He’s a person."

"He’s a person the Ship has a lot of graphs about," Kira said. "That’s what scares me." She jabbed a thumb toward the node over the door. "If it can pull strings like that for him, it can do it for anybody. 'Oh, Kira, your stress indices are rising, let’s send you to scrub algae for a while.'" She shuddered theatrically. "No thank you."

"Algae’s honest work," Morrow said.

"Algae smells like the inside of my boots," Kira said. "I prefer peppers."

Sera took a slow sip of her too-cool tea. It tasted like overused filters and someone else’s exhaustion.

"The routing could have been worse," she said. "They could have left him on the nodes." She set the mug down. "He was…overclocked. You saw it. If the choice is between him unraveling alone at a console or in a place where other people can notice, I’ll take the latter."

"Sure," Morrow said. "Until he has an episode in your sector and the review board starts asking why we let a pre-critical engineer near the nutrient mains." He tapped the table. "We get to carry that too."

"You think they’re going to blame us?" Kira asked.

"They always blame somebody," Morrow said. "If the Ship screws up, it calls it an optimization error and 'updates safeguards.' If a human screws up, it calls it a report and hangs it on a wall for training."

Sera thought of Jonah’s face when the Companion had used that word—optimization—for him. The way his shoulders had gone a fraction tighter, as if someone had added weight without asking.

"He didn’t screw up today," she said.

"Yet," Morrow said.

"You sound like the rumors," Sera said.

"I am the rumors," Morrow said with a half-grin. "I hear things." He ticked them off on his fingers. "That he integrated too well in his last eval. That the Ship flagged him as both 'asset' and 'liability' in the same breath. That he hears the hull talk back. That he’s on somebody’s watch list." He shrugged. "Hard to tell where the logs end and the superstition starts."

"People said plenty about Lydia too," Kira muttered. "Not all of it kind." She shot Sera a quick look, half-apologetic.

"Yeah," Sera said. Her voice came out flatter than she intended. "And none of that gossip helped when it mattered."

Silence settled for a moment. Somewhere in the pipes, a pump kicked on, the vibration running up through the soles of their boots.

"Do you trust it?" Kira asked suddenly.

"The tea unit?" Morrow said.

"The Ship," she said. "To know where to send people like him. Like us."

Sera traced the rim of her mug with one thumb.

"I trust it to follow its models," she said carefully. "I don’t always trust the models." She exhaled. "But I’ve seen it catch people we might have missed. And I’ve seen it miss people we should have seen."

"Comforting," Kira said dryly.

"I trust you," Sera added, meeting Kira’s eyes, then Morrow’s. "To say something if I start pacing the aisles at three in the morning talking to the lettuces."

"I’d say something if you did that anyway," Morrow said.

"Exactly," she said. "The Ship routes. We still have to notice each other."

Kira let out a breath that might have been a laugh.

"Fine," she said. "If I ever get the 'behavioral health optimization' ping, I’ll come sit in your jungle and complain until you kick me out."

"Deal," Sera said.

The Companion node over the door pulsed once, a soft acknowledgment.

"Routing stability for hydroponics staff remains within normative range," it said. "Peer support is a recognized protective factor."

"Don’t you start," Kira said, pointing her cup at it. "We were having a perfectly good wallow without your input."

"Input withdrawn," the AI said.

Morrow laughed.

Sera allowed herself a small smile.

Outside, beyond the thin wall of the break room, rows of green stretched out under steady light. Somewhere in the Ship’s deeper bands, Jonah Hale’s name sat in a model as a pre-critical flag, a line in a risk curve. In here, he was a man who had asked the peppers how they were doing and flinched at a flicker.

Both could be true.

"Shift’s not over," she said, pushing her chair back. Her legs ached when she stood. "Come on. The plants will gossip about us if we’re late."

"Plants are snitches," Kira said.

"And honest," Sera said. "Let’s try to be at least one of those."

They filed back out into the corridor, the break-room door hissing shut behind them. The Companion’s light stayed green, watching them go.
