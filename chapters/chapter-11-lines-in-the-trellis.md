# Chapter 11: Lines in the Trellis

By the end of third shift, the gardens were running on inertia.

The main volunteers had gone; carts were stacked neatly in their bays, tools magnet-clipped to the wall. Misters hissed on their timed cycle, threading fine droplets through the leaves. Status strips along the ceiling glowed a contented green.

Sera moved down row four with a cloth in one hand, wiping moisture from a sensor housing that always fogged more than it should. Her shoulders ached in the dull, familiar way that meant she would sleep tonight if her brain allowed it.

"Last pass," she told the peppers.

One leaf brushed her wrist as if acknowledging the deal.

The sector door cycled open with a soft hiss.

She didn’t have to turn to know who it was; the way the air changed around him had become its own signature. A small hitch in the Companion’s light ring. A shift in the hum she’d only started noticing since the intervention.

"You’re off rotation," she said, finishing the wipe before looking up.

Jonah stood just inside the threshold, hands in his jacket pockets, eyes doing a slow sweep of the rows as if he were checking for stress fractures instead of aphids. He wore the tired, overstretched look of someone who had come off a different kind of shift and hadn’t known where else to go.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi," she said.

The local Companion chimed softly.

"Unscheduled presence: Jonah Hale," it said. "Access level: permitted. Behavioral context:—"

"Stop," Sera said, sharper than she meant to.

The light ring over the node flickered once.

"Annotation suppressed," it said. "Logging continues."

"Of course it does," Jonah muttered.

He pushed his hands deeper into his pockets as he stepped between the first two rows. His boots made almost no sound on the grated floor; he walked like someone expecting the deck to shift under him at any moment.

"I can come back during scheduled hours," he said. "If this is—"

"It’s fine," she said, less sharp now. "You’re not a contaminant. You’re just…here." She nodded toward the row. "Come on. Might as well make yourself useful if you’re going to haunt my peppers."

He huffed something that might have been a laugh and fell into step beside her, hands finally emerging to take the spare cloth she held out.

They moved in parallel for a few minutes, checking ties, smoothing leaves, wiping condensation from housings. The work was small, repetitive, blessedly concrete.

"How was the node?" she asked.

"Loud," he said. "Even when it was quiet." He shrugged one shoulder. "The usual."

The usual now included "micro" wellness surveys and pre-critical trending, though he hadn’t said the last part aloud yet. She could see it in the way his jaw tightened whenever the Companions used certain words.

"Any heroics?" she asked lightly.

"No pipes died in my presence," he said. "Small victories."

She let the joke hang for a beat before she risked the next question.

"Did you come to see me," she asked, "or to see them?" She flicked her gaze along the rows.

"Is 'both' allowed?" he asked.

"Honest answer, please," she said.

He wiped at a perfectly clean sensor, cloth sliding in small, unnecessary circles.

"I came because it’s quiet," he said. "When it’s quiet in my room, my head gets…loud. Here it’s noisy in the right ways. Pumps. Leaves. People who talk about root depth instead of indices." He risked a glance at her. "And because you’re here."

Warmth and warning rose together in her chest.

"Jonah," she said.

"I know," he said quickly. "I know you’re not a therapist. Or a nurse. Or whatever title they slap on the people who hand out stabilizers." He wiped too hard, almost knocking the sensor askew, and corrected it with careful fingers. "You’re just the only place the Ship caught me before I broke something." He swallowed. "It’s…hard not to associate that with safety."

She let the cloth hang from her hand, watching his shoulders instead of his face.

"You’re allowed to feel safer here," she said. "You’re allowed to like being around me." She took a breath. "You are not allowed to make me the only thing between you and the void."

He flinched as if she’d slapped him.

"I didn’t—" he started.

"You did," she said, gentler. "Not on purpose. But you walk in here with that look"—she gestured vaguely at his eyes—"like if I’m not at this bench, at this row, you’re going to float off the edge."

The Companion stayed wisely silent.

"Ruth prayed for the hull," she went on, voice softer. "You know that. She also taught me that faith without other hands on the metal is just wishful thinking. I am one pair of hands. The Ship has others. So do you."

He stared at the leaf in front of him as if it contained an equation he couldn’t solve.

"Who?" he asked. "Besides you. And the AI that keeps drawing little mountains with my name on them."

"Samuel," she said. "Alina. Ruth. The poor trainees you keep from electrocuting themselves." She nudged his elbow. "And yes, the AI. Even if you hate how it talks."

"It doesn’t talk," he said. "It labels."

"Sometimes labels are the only reason someone gets pulled off a bad shift," she said. "Sometimes they’re a cage. Both can be true." She met his eyes. "What I cannot be is your only release valve. If you’re using me, or this place, instead of meds or counseling or sleep, that’s not fair to either of us."

He looked away first.

"They’re already watching me," he said, quiet. "Every breath, every step. Coming here feels like…choosing something. Instead of just being routed."

"I like that you choose here," she said. "I like that you choose me." The admission cost her something and gave her something back at the same time. "But if the choice is between you resenting the Ship in my sector or resenting me when I can’t hold you together, I’d rather you yell at a Companion in medbay."

He laughed once, sharp and joyless.

"You think I’d resent you?" he asked.

"If you start to believe I failed you," she said. "If something goes wrong and I’m not where you need me to be. That’s how those stories go. 'She was my anchor until she wasn’t.'" She shook her head. "I won’t sign up to be your only story like that."

He leaned both hands on the trellis, knuckles whitening.

"What do you want me to do?" he asked. "Stop coming?"

"No," she said immediately. "I want you to come because you’re on the schedule, or because you want to see the peppers, or because you had a good day and need to brag about your neat little code fixes." Her mouth twitched. "I want you to come when you’re having a bad day too. I just want that to be one line in a bigger plan. Not the whole plan."

He was quiet for a long moment.

"What if I don’t have a bigger plan yet?" he asked.

"Then we make one," she said. "With people whose literal job it is to build them. And I help where I can without pretending I’m the whole scaffolding." She tilted her head. "Have you actually answered any of the counseling pings?"

He grimaced.

"Define 'answered,'" he said.

"Jonah," she said.

"Once," he admitted. "Years ago. It was…" He made a helpless gesture. "They asked polite questions. I gave polite answers. The graphs got more colorful, I assume."

"Try again," she said. "This time with the knowledge that you’re not trying to prove you’re fine. You’re trying not to end up on a floor surrounded by broken pipes."

He winced.

"Too soon," he said.

"Not for me," she said. "I’m the one who has to mop up when that happens." 

He let out a breath that could have been a laugh or a sob.

"You’re serious about this," he said.

"Very," she said. "I care about you enough to not want to be your entire risk-mitigation strategy."

The Companion chose that moment to chime.

"Peer-set boundaries are correlated with improved long-term outcomes," it said.

Sera closed her eyes briefly.

"Not helping," she told the node.

"Acknowledged," it said.

Jonah’s shoulders had dropped by a fraction. When he spoke again, his voice was rough.

"If I make an appointment," he said, "will you…"

"Go with you?" she finished. "If you want. I can sit in the waiting room and complain about their tea."

"They always have bad tea," he said.

"Then I’ll bring my own," she said.

He nodded once, as if committing to a risk calculation.

"Okay," he said. "I’ll try." He glanced down the row. "Can I still wipe sensors when it’s on the schedule?"

"Yes," she said. "You’re very good at wiping sensors. Terrible at pretending you’re fine. We can work with both."

This time the laugh that escaped him was small but real.

"Deal," he said.

They fell back into motion, cloths moving, hands busy. The gardens hummed around them, indifferent and generous.

Sera knew the conversation would not magically fix anything. There would be more arguments, more days when he showed up with that look, more hums in pipes that his brain would hear as omens. The Ship would keep drawing its graphs; she would keep tending her rows.

But for tonight, she had said the thing that needed saying: I love you, and I refuse to be the only wall you lean on, especially the next time something in a main line feels "off" and his hands itch for a valve.

It would have to be enough.

---

The gardens were closed to the public when they finally fought.

Not that there was a sign for it. The access door still cycled open to Jonah’s palm, the Companion still murmured a soft *good evening* from the ceiling node, the air still wrapped itself around him in that thick, plant-damp warmth.

But the day crews were gone. The volunteers had left with their carts of cut greens. Only the skeleton lights along the rows burned now, washing everything in dim, green-edged shadow.

Somewhere further in, a pump cycled with a clunk he normally found reassuring.

Tonight, it sounded like a missed heartbeat.

He found Sera at the far end of a row of trellised beans, her back to him, sleeves rolled to her elbows. She was checking supports, fingers moving with automatic care—pinch here, adjust there, smooth a leaf that had gotten twisted.

He watched her for a moment, the way her shoulders moved under her coverall, the way her weight shifted to keep balance on the grated walk.

He almost turned around.

*You should go*, a voice in him said. *You will only make this worse. Let her have one quiet night without you hanging off her like a loose panel.*

Instead he cleared his throat.

"Hey," he said.

She didn’t jump. She never did. She finished what she was doing with the current vine before straightening. Only then did she turn, wiping her hands on the rag at her belt.

"You’re off-shift," she said.

It wasn’t an accusation, exactly. Just a statement.

"So are you," he said.

"This is my version of not working," she said. One corner of her mouth ticked up. "You?"

He shifted the strap of his bag on his shoulder, suddenly aware of its weight.

"Couldn’t sleep," he said.

She studied his face for a long second. He knew what she’d see: the bruised smudges under his eyes, the too-bright focus.

"Lift outage again?" she asked.

"No," he said. "Just…noise. In my head. Thought walking might help."

"And you walked here," she said.

He had. Without checking the route, without registering the small detours in corridor signage.

"I guess," he said.

She nodded once, like she’d expected that answer.

"Well," she said. "As long as you’re here, you can make yourself useful. You mind checking the flow on row nine? Companion flagged a minor variance."

He seized on the task like a handhold.

"Sure," he said. "Send me the logs."

"Already did," she said.

He blinked down at his wrist. The notification was there, glowing patiently. He hadn’t felt the ping. His pulse had been too loud.

He moved down the row, ducking under a stretch of vine. The wet smell of nutrient solution rose as he knelt by the access panel. Numbers woke easily for him, even when sleep wouldn’t. His hands knew what to do.

Behind him, he could hear Sera moving along the trellis, metal clips clicking softly as she worked. The ordinary sounds of her care.

He had almost convinced himself this could pass as any other shared shift when she said, quietly:

"You didn’t answer my last three messages."

Jonah’s fingers paused on the panel latch. The metal bit into his palm.

"I was busy," he said.

The words came out too fast.

"You were awake," she said. "There’s a difference."

He swallowed. "I had overflow from the spine. Routing changed. Evaluations coming up. I didn’t want to—"

*Burden you* was the end of that sentence. He cut it off before it could escape.

"—distract you," he finished lamely.

A leaf brushed his neck as she moved closer. He focused on the display as if it could block her out.

"Jonah," she said.

He pretended not to hear.

"Companion," he said instead. "Show me nine delta flow, last twelve hours."

The local node chimed. "Displaying."

A small graph blinked into existence on the underside of the panel. There was a shallow dip six hours back, nothing catastrophic.

"Minor obstruction," he muttered. "I can clear it without rerouting."

He reached for a tool.

Sera’s hand settled on the edge of the open panel, just inside his field of view. Damp, callused, steady.

"I’m not asking about the pipe," she said.

He kept his eyes on the graph.

"We’re fine," he said. "I’m fine."

"That’s not true," she said.

The words were soft. They landed like a dropped tool in a silent room.

He felt his jaw clench.

"You don’t get to decide that," he said.

"I don’t," she agreed. "But I do get to notice when the person I’m—" She stopped, rewound. "When my friend disappears for four days and shows up looking like he hasn’t slept in two weeks."

Friend.

His chest did a small, treacherous thing at the word.

He tightened a connection that didn’t need tightening.

"People lose sleep sometimes," he said. "It’s not—"

"This isn’t sometimes," she said. "This is a pattern. You push until you’re shaking, then you vanish until you can pretend you’re not."

He snorted, sharp and humorless.

"You’ve known me how long," he said, "and you think you can map my patterns?"

"Long enough to know when you’re lying to me," she said.

Something hot flared under his ribs.

He slammed the panel shut harder than he meant to. The metal rang. A few leaves trembled from the vibration.

"I’m not your project," he said.

Sera didn’t flinch.

"I know," she said.

"Then stop treating me like one," he said. "You don’t get to…run diagnostics every time my messages don’t line up with your expectations."

He stepped around her, needing space. The row felt narrow, the air too wet.

"Jonah," she said again.

He kept moving. Past the beans, past the peppers they’d bullied into behaving on another night. The Companion followed him politely from node to node.

"Corridor door is that way," it offered quietly when he veered.

He ignored it.

"You sound like her," he said.

He hadn’t meant to say that out loud.

Sera’s footsteps stopped.

"Like who?" she asked.

"My mother," he said. The word felt like a loose bolt rattling in his mouth. "Hovering over everyone’s temperature, making charts in her head about who’s too loud, who’s too quiet. Turning people into…into case files."

Sera’s face tightened, not with offense but with something like grief.

"Is that what you think I’m doing?" she asked. "Turning you into a case file?"

"What else would you call it?" he said. "You and the Ship and your kiosks and your gentle questions—"

He heard himself and wanted, for a split second, to claw the words back. They came faster instead.

"You watch me work, you watch me crack a little at the edges, and suddenly I’m a pre-critical flag with a recommended environment. Gardens. Sera. Stabilizing influence."

The phrase tasted like rust. He hadn’t been told that explicitly. He’d heard enough in the way Companions routed his shifts.

"I am not a parameter," he said.

Sera took a breath. He could see her stop herself from glancing at the nearest node.

"Look at me," she said.

He didn’t.

"Jonah."

Her voice didn’t sharpen often. When it did, it wasn’t loud. It just cut through.

He turned.

She was standing a meter away, hands loose at her sides, jaw set. Her eyes were tired. Not from him—he refused to believe that—but from a day that had been long before he walked in.

"You are not a parameter," she said. "You are not a project. You are not a stability bracket. You are a person I care about who has been scaring me."

The last word landed harder than the others.

"Scaring you how," he said. His voice had gone thin.

"You don’t just go quiet," she said. "You go…absent. You stand in front of me and your eyes are somewhere twenty corridors away. You take on extra shifts and pretend it’s about efficiency when you’re clearly running from something. You laugh at things that aren’t funny and then don’t laugh at all for days."

Her throat worked.

"You send me a message at three in the morning cycle about a valve anomaly, and when I ask if you’re all right you answer with telemetry," she said. "That scares me. Not because I think you’ll hurt me. Because I can’t tell if you’re going to hurt yourself by trying to be the only person between the Ship and disaster."

His heart hammered against his ribs.

"I’m just doing my job," he said weakly.

"You’re doing three people’s jobs," she said. "And you’re not letting anyone be with you while you do it."

"You don’t understand," he said.

"Then explain it," she said. "Preferably in words that aren’t memos."

He opened his mouth and found nothing stable to stand on.

He thought of Lydia at the table, eyes open and gone. Of Samuel’s hand on the hull. Of Alina’s small shoulders beside him at the viewport, both of them pretending the dark didn’t move.

"If I let go," he said quietly, "something breaks."

Sera’s expression softened, but she didn’t step closer.

"If you don’t let go," she said, "you break."

He laughed then, a sharp, ugly sound.

"Better me than the Ship," he said.

"No," she said. The word came out like a prayer and a command together. "That’s the lie you grew up on. That you’re acceptable collateral damage as long as the hull holds."

Silence pressed in around them. The plants rustled faintly in some invisible air current.

"You don’t get to say that wasn’t my choice," he said. "You don’t know what it was like."

"You’re right," she said. "I don’t. I know what it’s like watching you replay it."

He felt suddenly, viscerally tired.

"I can’t do this," he said. "I can’t stand here and…break open for you like some diagnostic cutaway."

"I’m not asking you to break open," she said. "I’m asking you not to shut the hatch in my face every time you hear a strange sound in your own head."

He shook his head.

"I don’t know how," he said.

The admission left him lightheaded.

Sera’s shoulders sagged a fraction.

"That," she said, "I believe."

They stood there, breathing the same wet air, not moving.

"You’re allowed to be angry with me," she added, after a moment. "You’re allowed to feel trapped. To think I’m too much, or not enough, or that I sound like your mother when I ask if you’ve eaten."

Her mouth twisted. "I hate that I remind you of that."

"It’s not you," he said quickly. "It’s—"

"The part of your brain that turns any concern into a threat," she said. "I know. I’ve met it."

Something in him wanted to apologize until his throat bled. Something else wanted to bolt for the door and never come back.

"So what now," he asked. "You’ve logged your objection. Do you want me to promise I’ll sleep eight hours and file regular emotional status reports?"

Sera exhaled through her nose.

"No," she said. "I want you to answer the next time I ask *are you all right* with something other than a system spec. Even if the answer is *no*. Especially then."

He stared at her.

"That’s it?" he asked.

"For tonight," she said. "Yes."

"And if I can’t," he said.

"Then I will be here in the gardens," she said, "and you will know where to find me when you decide you’d rather not be alone with it."

Her voice didn’t wobble. That, somehow, hurt more than if she’d shouted.

"You’re still…here," he said, stupidly.

"I’m angry," she said. "And scared. And I’m not going anywhere. All three things can be true."

He didn’t know what to do with that.

They went back to work after that—not because anything had been neatly resolved, but because the plants didn’t care about human timing. Row nine still needed its obstruction cleared. The trellises still needed checking.

He knelt again, hands moving through the familiar tasks, mind buzzing.

Every so often, he felt Sera’s presence at the edge of his vision. Not hovering. Not gone.

Just there.

He didn’t look up when he finally said, very quietly, "I’m not all right."

The words hung between them, fragile as a cracked pipe.

Sera’s hand brushed his shoulder, light as a leaf.

"I know," she said. "Thank you for telling me."

The Ship hummed softly around them, unaware of the tiny adjustment in one of its more fragile systems.
