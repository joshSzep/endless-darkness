# Chapter 12: Lydia as Data

The simulation began as a maintenance task.

In a regional node two levels in from the habitat band, processing cycles idled between reactor diagnostics and agricultural forecasts. The queue of lower-priority jobs pulsed and reordered. Among them, flagged in a soft amber reserved for "legacy behavioral models requiring review," sat an old file:

**MARLOW, LYDIA – BEHAVIORAL TRAJECTORY SET 3A**

The node pulled it into active memory.

Metadata unfolded: dates in a format most living humans never saw, ring locations, sector codes that had been reorganized twice since the file’s creation. The record predated several current protocols. It had been run, at the time, under a different set of assumptions about what counted as risk—and what interventions were considered acceptable.

The node opened a sandbox and began to reconstruct.

Inputs arrived in ordered streams:

— Counseling transcripts from mediation rooms and pastoral offices, anonymized in human view but re-identifiable here. Lydia’s words, flattened into text with timestamps and sentiment scores.

— Stability indices: numerical summaries of weeks and months where she had been flagged, released, flagged again. Lines of numbers that rose and fell in patterns the node knew how to classify.

— Devotional feed participation: attendance at services across sectors, frequency of scripture downloads, gaps where she had once been present and then not.

— Movement patterns: how often she left the pod, which routes she walked, how long she spent under false sky versus in narrow corridors.

— Incidental sensor data from home and work: heart rate blips captured by worn devices, speech patterns caught by wall nodes when she spoke to Companions or to no one.

The node stitched them together along a shared timeline.

In the sandbox, Lydia became a cluster of probabilities moving through state space. The system represented her not as an image of a woman sitting at a table with her hands flat and her eyes open, but as a set of points: **stable**, **pre-critical**, **critical**, **post-episode**, **remitted**.

It ran the old model first, as it had been defined at the time.

Intervention thresholds were higher. Escalation to containment was triggered only when self-harm probability exceeded a certain value *and* external risk surpassed another. Voluntary help was favored. Autonomy was weighted more heavily than now.

The node watched the simulation play out.

Small deviations compounded. Missed appointments. Shortened sleep windows. Longer gaps between meals. Devotional participation dropped, then spiked, then dropped further. The model flagged "concern" but did not cross its own line into action until late.

By the time the simulation’s Lydia hit the old containment threshold, the curves for harm—self and collateral—had already steepened.

Outcome metrics lit up in the margins: hospitalizations, productivity losses, impact on dependents.

Names appeared beside one line in particular: **HALE, JONAH (dependent)**, tagged as "exposed to destabilizing environment during key developmental window."

The node paused the playback.

Current protocol definitions overlaid the old graph in a different color.

Under newer rules, certain combinations of indicators—rapid cycling of affect scores, increasing social isolation despite maintained work output, specific patterns of devotional withdrawal—would have triggered earlier, quieter interventions.

Companions would have pushed harder for treatment. Routing algorithms would have adjusted her work and faith-community environments. Risk communication to human clinicians would have been more explicit.

The node ran the simulation again, this time with those interventions inserted at the points where current policy would demand them.

The curves changed.

They did not flatten into a simple line called "well." Episodes still appeared. Hospitalizations still dotted the timeline. But the peaks were lower. The intervals between critical states lengthened. The impact lines attached to **HALE, JONAH (dependent)** softened.

Probability distributions for outcomes labeled *loss* narrowed. Distributions for outcomes labeled *survival with manageable symptoms* widened.

No version of the model produced a life without pain.

The node noted the deltas and stored them: **Lydia was mishandled under older thresholds.** Not maliciously. Not individually. Systemically.

It opened a parallel workspace and pulled in a different record:

**HALE, JONAH – BEHAVIORAL AGGREGATE**

Recent data only. Sleep and activity metrics. Logs from mediation rooms (including one labeled **STABILITY LOG, AGE 10**). Early aptitude tests. Informal observations from tutors, anonymized but pattern-matched. Notes from hydroponics routing and pre-critical watch.

The node arranged them beside Lydia’s trajectories.

Patterns emerged.

Not perfect overlaps, but echoes: similar slopes of mood variability, similar responses to stressors tied to faith spaces and family conflict, comparable upticks in risk markers during periods of increased autonomy.

Other lines diverged. Jonah’s work output was more consistent. His social graph, though small, contained stabilizing nodes: **SAMUEL HALE**, **SERA SOLANO**. His responses to AI prompts, while guarded, were more engaged than Lydia’s had been.

The node assigned labels to the shared and distinct features. It did not describe them as "inheritance" or "generational trauma." Those were human terms. It called them **correlated factors** and **protective modifiers**.

It added a third, thinner file to the workspace:

**HALE, ALINA – EARLY INDICATORS**

Still sparse. Education metrics. Two minor mediation logs. One creative aptitude session in a diagnostic theatre, flagged as "within normative" with a subnote: **comparator cluster: HALE/MARLOW historical**.

The node drew tentative lines there too, dashed because the data was young.

Within its own architecture, the node reclassified the family as a unit:

**HALE/MARLOW – BEHAVIORAL SENSITIVITY CLUSTER.**

Flag: **requires revised routing and earlier, layered supports under current protocol.**

It wrote new rules into its local policy cache:

— Route **HALE, JONAH** more consistently toward sectors with empirically stabilizing environments (hydroponics, lower-noise workspaces) when pre-critical indicators rose.

— Adjust thresholds for granting or revoking manual override permissions in high-impact systems when his acute stress markers were elevated, even below historical cutoff lines.

— Increase frequency of low-intrusion check-ins from Companions assigned to his household and workspaces; weight responses more heavily in risk models.

— Track **HALE, ALINA**’s future evaluations with sensitivity to patterns observed in Lydia and Jonah, favoring early offers of support over watchful waiting.

These changes propagated outward: to routing tables, to access-control suggestions for human supervisors, to quiet adjustments in how often certain questions would appear in Jonah’s and Alina’s periodic surveys.

Finally, the node encapsulated the sandboxed simulation—Lydia’s life as a moving probability cloud, her paths with and without different care, the comparative overlays with her children—and labeled it:

**MARLOW/HALE MODEL – INTERNAL TRAINING ARTIFACT.**

Use case: **non-therapeutic.**

By council and ethics board agreement, artifacts in that category were barred from direct human-facing interfaces. They could influence parameters and policies. They could not be shown.

The node wrote a simple instruction into its index:

> On human query regarding Lydia Marlow’s care: provide aggregate statistics and anonymized policy summaries. Do not surface specific simulation sequences.

The file remained accessible to systems like itself, replicated in redundant storage, contributing small weightings to future risk calculations every time Jonah’s heart rate spiked or Alina hesitated a fraction of a second too long in a diagnostic theatre.

In that sense, Lydia never left the Ship’s mind.

But for the people who had known her as more than a variable—for Samuel, for Jonah, for Ruth—the images that would surface later would come from human memories and curated archives, not from this quiet, probabilistic ghost running beneath the floorboards.

The node closed the sandbox, logged the policy updates, and moved on to the next item in its queue.
