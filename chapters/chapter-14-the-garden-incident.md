# Chapter 14: The Garden Incident

By the time Jonah reached the gardens, he was already late.

The lift had stalled twice on the way down from the training ring, once for a full thirty seconds. Long enough for the car to judder, for the lights to dim a fraction, for the old corridor fear to flare in his chest before the Companion assured him—too calmly—that it was a routine power redistribution.

He'd believed it. On the surface. The other part of him had started counting again.

One hum, two hum, three.

Now, as the pressure door to Sector G-3 cycled open, the air hit him like a wet cloth. Hydroponics always did this—soft, damp, green—but today it felt heavier. It clung to the back of his throat. His glasses fogged at the edges before the adaptive coating compensated.

"Technician Hale, Jonah," the entrance Companion said from a ceiling node. "Anomaly ticket G-3-112, nutrient main pressure variance. Severity: low. Thank you for responding."

"Logged," Jonah said.

His voice sounded normal to his own ears. That was something.

He adjusted the strap of his tool bag and glanced at his wrist display. The ticket icon pulsed: *Main loop D, segment 7B: pressure oscillation outside optimal band. Automated safeguards in place.*

Low severity. Simple. The kind of thing they'd routed him to hydroponics for a dozen times in the last cycle.

His hands still buzzed. Somewhere under the static of adrenaline sat the flat fact of his last node shift: pre-critical trending, behavioral session booked for after this block, as if the Ship believed he could hold himself together just a little longer.

Rows of greenery stretched away under the grow-lights: towers of vines, waist-high troughs humming with slow circulation, trellises heavy with broad leaves. The artificial day here was a warm spectrum, more like afternoon than the corridor's harsh white. Condensation beaded on pipes and rails. Drops fell in a slow, irregular pattern that Jonah's brain immediately tried to sync with his pulse.

"Row cluster seven," he murmured. "It's fine. It's a loop resonance. We look, we confirm, we go home."

"Home," the word felt thin in his mouth.

"You're talking to yourself again," a voice said from between the rows.

He turned too fast. The room swayed a little before it settled.

Sera stepped out from behind a column of tomato vines, sleeves rolled to her elbows, forearms damp. Her coverall was darker along the front where nutrient solution had splashed and dried. Her hair, pulled back at the nape of her neck, had lost the battle with humidity hours ago.

"Occupational hazard," Jonah said. "If I stop narrating, the Ship forgets what it's doing."

The joke landed crooked. Sera's mouth twitched, but her eyes had already started their slow scan of his face: eyes, shadows, jaw, the way he held his shoulders.

"Lift stuck again?" she asked.

"Power redistribution," he said. "Nothing dramatic."

"Uh-huh." She wiped her hands on the rag at her belt. "Ticket says main D, seven-B. I checked the plants, nothing's wilting. Companion says it's a blip."

"Companion says a lot of things are blips," Jonah said. "Sometimes they're right. Sometimes they're...early. Sometimes they call you pre-critical and still route you into sectors with valves you can reach."

He checked his display again though he knew exactly what it said. The numbers swam for a moment before they snapped into focus. Pressure oscillation, plus/minus two percent. Safeties holding. No leak detected.

*Low severity*, the system insisted.

His body disagreed. His heart was already too fast. Breath a little shallow. The buzz in his hands threatened to become a tremor if he looked at it directly. It reminded him of Sera's voice in G-3 days ago, telling him she wouldn't be his only wall, especially when something in a main line felt wrong.

"We can do this later," Sera said quietly. "Log it, bump it to day shift. They'll love the excuse to feel useful."

"It's tagged for now," Jonah said. "Routing logic put me here."

The Companion above the entrance pinged as if on cue.

"Routine support routing," it said. "Sector G-3 has available stabilizing environmental factors. Technician Hale's presence here is advisable."

Sera shot a look at the nearest audio node, then back at Jonah.

"You hear that?" she said. "You are *advisable*."

"Worst compliment," Jonah said.

She huffed out a breath that could almost have been a laugh.

"Walk with me," she said. "We check seven-B together. If it's nothing, you go home and sleep. If it's something, you tell me what to yell at the Ship. Deal?"

He hesitated. The prudent answer was yes. The part of him still trying to outrun the corridor fear wanted the anomaly gone, not shared.

"Deal," he said.

They moved down the main aisle, boots soft on the grated floor. The sounds of the sector folded around them: fans, drip-lines, the quiet rush of solution in hidden conduits. Jonah's brain, traitor that it was, began laying those noises over other memories—hull creaks in Samuel's corridors, the whispered rhythm of Ruth's prayer in the dark.

*Lord, hold the hull. Hold the rings. Hold the hands that hold the Ship.*

He'd been ten, maybe, counting the beats between words and the ticks in the wall.

Now he counted pump cycles instead.

One hum, two hum, three.

They turned into the narrower lane between row clusters. The air was cooler here, denser. Moisture beaded on the vertical supports.

"Companion," Jonah said. "Local status for main loop D, seven-B. Raw values."

A panel near his shoulder brightened, scrolling numbers.

"Pressure: nominal with minor oscillation within safety band," the Companion said. "Flow rate: stable. No leaks detected. Stress signatures: unchanged from baseline."

He stepped closer, leaning in until the display's light washed his face.

The oscillation graph was small, noise hugging the centerline. He knew what "safe" looked like. This was that. Mostly.

"Zoom," he said.

The graph expanded, stretching minor fluctuations into hills and valleys. The oscillation wasn't random. It had a shape. A periodicity. A pattern.

His chest tightened.

"That's just pump harmonics," Sera said, standing a little back. "You've said that before. You said it last week."

"Last week it didn't hit this phase," Jonah said. "Look—" He tapped two points on the display, overlaying them. "Here. And here. The troughs are deepening."

"Within safe limits," the Companion repeated.

"Until they're not," Jonah snapped.

The word came out sharper than he'd meant. Sera went still for a fraction of a second, then simply shifted her weight, making space.

"Okay," she said. "So walk me through what you see. Like I'm a bored trainee."

"You're never bored," he said.

"Flattery won't distract me," she said. "Explain."

He exhaled, tried to line up his thoughts.

"Main D loops through five sectors," he said. "G-3 is second on the chain. If we get a resonance here and no one notices because it's within band, it can amplify downstream. A small crack now becomes a rupture three sectors away, with more volume and load and people standing under it."

Images flickered in his head with unwelcome clarity: a pipe bursting over a crowded aisle, trellises collapsing, people slipping in nutrient solution that looked too much like blood if you didn't think about it.

"So we don't wait," he said. "We damp it. We bleed pressure before it stacks."

"And the Ship hasn't done that on its own because..." Sera prompted.

"Because the model says we're fine," Jonah said. "Because it's weighting resource use and disruption against a low-probability failure. Because it's wrong sometimes."

There it was—that thin edge of resentment he hated hearing in his own voice. The part of him that knew too much about how the AI thought to trust it blindly, and too much about himself to trust his own doubts.

"What would you do," Sera asked, "if this were just numbers and no people?"

He stared at the graph.

"I'd run a controlled flush on D through bypass three," he said slowly. "Short drop in pressure, bleed the resonance, refill from buffer tanks."

"And with people?" she asked.

"We notify adjacent sectors, clear the aisles, stage for a small mess," he said. "Then do it."

"Have you notified anyone?" she said.

"It's low severity," the Companion said again, as if answering for him.

The hum under the floor dipped half a note.

Jonah's skin prickled.

"Companion," he said. "Authorize controlled flush on main D, G-3 node, through bypass three. Prepare adjacent sector alerts."

There was a fractional pause—just like the one in H-14, when Sera had asked about routing.

"Authorization requires supervisor clearance," the Companion said. "Standard procedure for main loop interventions."

"Override under emergency prevention," Jonah said. His mouth had already formed the words before he consciously decided to. "Engineer Hale, Jonah. Tier three access. Tag reason code: resonance risk mitigation."

Another pause. Longer.

"Request forwarded to supervisory queue," the Companion said. "Estimated response time: twelve minutes."

Twelve minutes. Long enough for nothing to happen. Long enough for something small to start.

His heart pounded against his ribs in an off-beat sync with the pumps.

One hum, two hum—

"Or," he said, too loudly, "we can do the right thing now."

He stepped past Sera toward the manual panel.

"Jonah," she said.

"It's a textbook damp," he said. "I teach this to trainees in sims."

"In sims," she said.

He opened the metal cover. Physical valves, analog backups—relics, almost. A memory of the days when people didn't trust software alone.

His fingers closed around the first handle.

"Companion," Sera said. "Is there an active emergency in G-3?"

"No," it said. "There is a low-severity anomaly under observation."

"Then there is no emergency override," she said, stepping closer. "Jonah. Look at me."

He didn't. If he looked at her he'd see his fear on her face and he couldn't—

The valve handle was smooth under his palm. Cool, slightly damp from condensation.

*If he let go*, his mind whispered, *the pattern would keep building. Somewhere, some when, the line would give. Someone would be under it. It would be his fault for walking away.*

He'd already done that once. A doorway, his mother on the floor, a Ship that had logged his absence as neatly as any other datapoint. This time, it would log his hand on the metal instead.

His grip tightened.

"Lord, hold the hull," Ruth's voice said in his memory. "Hold the rings. Hold the hands that hold the Ship." His ten-year-old self had counted her words against the clicks in the wall. Now the clicks were pump relays, light strips, the almost inaudible tick of his own teeth.

"Jonah," Sera said again. Softer, closer. "You are not the only thing between us and vacuum. Let go."

He pulled.

It was not a dramatic motion. A quarter turn, the hiss of a seal shifting, the deep belly-sound of pressure re-routing. Somewhere above them, valves cycled with dull, obedient thuds.

On the panel, the pressure graph jumped.

"Manual bypass engaged," the Companion said. Its voice had lost none of its calm. "Adjusting."

For half a second, the numbers moved the way he'd expected: a dip, a wobble, a reassuring trend toward flatter oscillation.

Then another line lit up in red.

"Warning," the Companion said. "Unexpected back-pressure on branch E. Stress on support trellis six."

"What?" Jonah breathed.

A sharp metallic crack answered from somewhere down the aisle. The sound bit through the humid air like a snapped bone.

Sera was already moving.

"Row six!" she shouted. "Everyone out of the aisles!"

Jonah followed the sound, boots slipping once on the damp grating. As he rounded the end of the row, the world telescoped into a single, wrong image: a main line along the ceiling bulging where it met a joint, metal bracket flexing under loads it hadn't been meant to take.

Below it, a trellis thick with fruit and leaves sagged dangerously, its supports groaning.

Two volunteers stood frozen halfway down the row, one with a crate in her hands, the other with a cutter slung at his hip.

"Move!" Sera yelled, already wading into the dripping shadows. "Drop it, go—"

The joint gave.

Nutrient solution burst out in a high, white arc, hammering the trellis. The supports snapped in quick, ugly pops. Metal, wood composite, and plants crashed sideways, turning the narrow aisle into a tangle of weight and motion.

The crate hit the floor. The volunteer with the cutter slipped, feet shooting out from under him. He went down hard, disappearing under a slumping net of vines and pipe.

Someone screamed.

Jonah's body moved before his thoughts did.

He splashed into the mess, solution soaking his legs, cold seeping through fabric to skin. His boots slid, caught, slid again. The air was suddenly full of smells: nutrient, bruised leaves, a metallic tang that wasn't blood but hit the same place in his brain.

"Companion, cut flow!" Sera shouted.

"Automated safeties engaged," it said. "Pressure dropping. Structural load exceeded. Evacuate row cluster six. Medical team en route."

The trellis over the fallen volunteer shifted with a wet groan.

Jonah grabbed for the nearest support, fingers finding slick metal. For a second he bore some of the weight, enough that the man's face came into view—wide eyes, mouth flexing around a word Jonah couldn't hear over the noise.

His arms trembled.

One hum, two hum, three—

The hum wasn't the pumps anymore. It was inside his skull.

Data he hadn't asked for now smeared across his vision in imagined overlays: failure rates, stress tolerances, casualty projections. He'd seen enough logs, enough sims, to supply the numbers himself.

*If the trellis slips another twelve degrees, average crush injury probability in the thoracic region increases to—*

"Jonah!" Sera's voice cut through, close and fierce. "Let go of that, it's not yours. Get his shoulders."

He blinked, vision stuttering. The support in his hands wasn't a valve, wasn't the Ship itself. It was a single, replaceable brace.

He shifted his grip, hands sliding to the man's upper arms instead. Sera got under the worst of the trellis, muscles standing out in her forearms. Together, grunting, they dragged the man sideways through the slurry of leaves and solution.

He came free in a tangle of limbs, coughing, eyes screwed shut against dripping fluid.

"You're okay," Sera said breathlessly, patting his shoulder once before turning back to scan for anyone else.

"Minor lacerations," the Companion reported. "No apparent fractures. Medical response in one minute, forty seconds."

More voices now. People who'd heard the crack and the shout. Footsteps in the main aisle, questions, the high static of someone starting to panic.

The emergency floods snapped on.

White light obliterated the warm garden spectrum. Shadows vanished. Everything—the broken trellis, the spilled solution, Sera's soaked coverall, Jonah's own shaking hands—flattened into a stark, clinical scene that could have been medbay already.

The hum in Jonah's head rose.

He staggered back against the wall, shoulder hitting a valve housing hard enough to bruise. The world pinched at the edges, like someone was narrowing a camera aperture.

"Technician Hale, Jonah," the Companion said. "Your manual intervention contributed to the back-pressure event. Containment protocols are being evaluated. Please step away from control interfaces."

The words slotted neatly into him like a drill bit.

*You did this.*

*You pulled the handle.*

*You were right about the pattern and wrong about the fix.*

His breath hitched, went shallow. The air felt suddenly thin despite the humidity. The rows seemed to lean in on either side, trellises crowding closer, as if the Ship had decided to fold this one corridor down around him.

"Jonah," Sera said. She was in front of him now, close enough that he could see droplets on her lashes. "Look at me. You're still here."

He tried. For a heartbeat he managed it—her face, flushed and intent, anchoring him.

Behind her, over her shoulder, the emergency floods flickered as the system rerouted power to compensate for the sudden load changes. The light pulsed in a slow, arrhythmic beat.

Black-white, black-white, black—

For half a breath the sector seemed to erase itself. No rows, no pipes, no ceiling. Just the idea of absence where the hull should be.

Then the lights came back, harsher than before.

Jonah's knees wanted to go.

"Lord, hold the hull," he heard himself whisper. "Hold the rings. Hold—"

"Jonah," Sera said sharply. "Hands. Show me your hands."

He looked down.

They were shaking. Not a fine tremor now, but a visible jitter, as if his skin couldn't remember where it was supposed to end. Nutrient solution dripped from his fingers in slow, viscous lines.

"Companion," Sera said without taking her eyes off him. "Status on Jonah Hale."

"Heart rate one hundred and forty-two," it said. "Respiration elevated. Behavioral indicators consistent with acute stress response. Subject is on pre-critical watch."

There it was. Said aloud, not just a quiet yellow icon in a node interface he’d stared at alone.

*Pre-critical.*

He laughed. It came out wrong—too high, too thin. People turned.

"I'm fine," he said. "It was just—just poor modeling, we'll fix the parameters, I'll rerun the sims, it's nothing, it's—"

The words stacked faster than his tongue could handle them. Thoughts crashed into each other in his skull, shards of procedure and prayer and old fear.

"Technician Hale," the Companion said, its tone unchanged. "Please comply with instructions. Step away from the manual control panel and remain seated until medical arrives."

"You shouldn't have let me," he said, to the air, to the ceiling node, to the thing behind it. "You knew the pattern. You knew. You routed me here, you put—" He gestured vaguely at the broken trellis, the shivering volunteer, the white glare. "You put all of this in my path and then you say *pre-critical* like it's a surprise."

"Routing decisions are made based on aggregate risk reduction," it said. "Your presence here decreased expected harm."

"Did it?" he demanded.

Sera's hand closed around his wrist. Not gentle, not rough. Firm.

"Jonah," she said. "Not here. Not like this."

He could feel his pulse pounding under her fingers, wild and uncoordinated.

Somewhere above them, another Companion voice cut in over the local one. Flatter. Less human. The timbre he associated with ship-wide announcements that people remembered for decades.

"Containment protocol sixty-three activated," it said. "Subject Jonah Hale – AI Engineer (Tier 3) flagged for immediate medical stabilization. Access to high-autonomy controls temporarily revoked pending review."

The words printed themselves in the air of his mind in the same font the ship used on walls.

**HALE, JONAH – AI ENGINEER (TIER 3)**

He saw it as clearly as if it were already on a medbay screen.

Doors at the end of the sector corridor cycled to amber. A low chime sounded, then repeated on a slow interval. People shifted, looking around, instinctively moving toward exits even as they tried to help with the mess.

Jonah's chest tightened further. The room shrank. The hum under everything climbed toward a pitch that made his teeth ache.

"You can't—" he started, though he wasn't sure who he meant. The AI. The Ship. God. "You can't put me in a box and call it safety. You don't know—"

"Jonah," Sera said. "Breathe."

"Medical team arriving," the Companion said. "Please make way."

They came in through the main aisle: two med techs in gray with blue bands at their sleeves, a security officer in darker uniform, a small floating rig loaded with supplies. Jonah saw the rig first—the neat clips, the sealed vials, the restraint foam coiled like a patient animal.

His body reacted as if someone had opened an airlock.

Adrenaline hit, leaving his hands cold and his vision hot. The edges of his sight blurred, darkening, as if the gardens were receding into a tunnel and only the approaching team remained in focus.

"Subject appears conscious and ambulatory," one of the med techs said. Their voice had the smooth cadence of someone used to being recorded.

"Acute stress," the Companion supplied. "Pre-existing risk factors. Recent manual override contributing to minor structural incident."

Minor. Jonah looked at the man they'd pulled from under the trellis, now sitting against a support, holding a cold pack to his shoulder. At Sera, soaked and pale but upright. At the hanging drip of solution from the broken line.

"I'm not a subject," he said, though it came out hoarse. "I'm right here."

"We know," Sera said.

The nearer med tech—tall, hair cropped close, eyes clear and tired—stopped a meter away, palms open.

"Technician Hale," they said. "I'm Daren. We're here to make sure you're safe. No one is in trouble. We just want to get you somewhere quieter and check your vitals properly."

Their words slotted into place alongside the Companion's, as practiced as any script. Jonah's brain parsed them, looking for hidden clauses.

*Safe.* 

*Quieter.*

*Check.*

"I have a shift," he said. "There's a ticket. The model—"

"The ticket is covered," Daren said. "The model can wait. You can't."

Somewhere in the background, the Companion's voice blended with another, higher-band process, trading load reports Jonah couldn't quite follow. The hum in his head refused to drop.

"Jonah," Sera said again. "Please. Go with them. Don't make this another thing you carry alone."

Her hand was still on his wrist. He could feel the callus from a pruning knife under her thumb.

He swallowed.

He could see the path if he refused—security stepping in, hands on his elbows, the words "for your own safety" stamped over the moment like a hatch seal. Another scene he'd have to watch later on some screen, trying to reconcile the way he knew himself with the way the Ship did.

"Containment does not mean punishment," the Companion said, as if reading the space between his thoughts. "It is a safety boundary. You are not being removed from the mission."

*Yet*, his mind supplied.

He closed his eyes for one long breath. In the dark behind his lids, he saw the pressure graph again, the deepening troughs, the flooded row, the man's face under the trellis. He saw Lydia's file trailing off into blankness where interventions should have been.

"Okay," he said. The word scraped his throat. "Okay. I'll go."

Sera's grip loosened, then shifted to his hand.

"I'll come find you after shift," she said. "Medbay, wherever. I'm not leaving you there alone."

He nodded, though the idea of anyone seeing him like this made his skin crawl. He clung to her promise anyway, a small, solid thing in the flood.

Daren stepped closer, still with those open, empty hands.

"Thank you," they said simply. "We're going to walk together, alright? No rush."

The security officer fell in a step behind, not touching, just present. The restraint foam stayed coiled on the rig.

As they moved toward the exit, the crowd parted with the instinctive, uncomfortable ripple of people watching something they didn't want to be reminded could happen to them. Conversations dipped, then rose in their wake, already reshaping the scene into story.

The hatch to the corridor cycled open on amber.

Jonah stepped through, into a light that felt suddenly too thin.

---

Sofi only meant to cut through the concourse and pick up coriander.

G-3’s side market always smelled faintly of damp soil and metal trays, a thin green breath that slipped under the sharper notes of oil and fried batter from the food stalls. You could taste the gardens in the air there, even if you never had clearance to step inside the sector proper. On good days, when shifts lined up, Sera sometimes brought out a tray of bruised seedlings for cheap and let Sofi argue her down out of principle.

Today the air met Sofi like a closed fist.

The corridor leading toward the G-3 hatch was jammed with people. Lines that should have flowed smoothly past the side kiosks had kinked and knotted; bodies pressed shoulder to shoulder, voices overlapped in a rising, metallic echo. Above, the status strip that usually cycled through plant schedules and humidity stats showed a steady, unblinking band of amber.

LOCKDOWN – SECTOR G-3. NO ENTRY.

"Excuse me," Sofi murmured, though there was nowhere for anyone to go. She shifted her crate of nutrient pucks against her hip, feeling the edge bite into her palm. She was only two corridors away from her own hydroponics bay, close enough that the air felt almost familiar, and suddenly she could not see a single familiar face.

The hatch to G-3 loomed ahead, a thick oval of metal inset with a glass panel. Normally, you could see a slice of the compression lock beyond, the faint suggestion of brighter, wetter air. Now the glass showed only the matte slide of an inner barrier sealed tight behind it, hazard chevrons pulsing along the frame.

"We just came out for ten minutes," a woman near the front said, voice high and thin. She had a small child half-buried in the fabric at her hip. "My partner's still inside. She's on row four this week. You can't just—"

"Please stand clear of the hatch," the Companion said from the ceiling node. Its voice was smooth as always, genderless, placid. "Sector G-3 is under temporary operational lockdown for localized stabilization. There is no mission threat. All personnel inside are in monitored environments."

"What does that mean?" someone else called. "Monitored how?"

The Companion did not answer that. Its status light glowed steady green.

Sofi edged sideways, trying to get a better angle on the hatch. The child near the front wriggled free enough to see the sealed door and started to cry, a hiccuping, bewildered sound.

"I want the tall trees," the child sobbed. "You said we'd see the tall trees."

"Later, baby," the woman said, knuckles whitening on the child's shirt. "Later. They'll open again later."

Sofi swallowed. G-3’s trellis rows were famous even on the other side of the agricultural cylinder. They trained the tomatoes higher there, let the vines arc overhead like a tunnel. Kids called it the red forest.

"Companion," a man in a maintenance vest asked sharply, raising his hand as if in a classroom. "Is this a drill?"

"No," the voice said. "This is a live response to an internal anomaly. There is no mission threat. Please follow rerouting instructions."

New arrows blinked to life along the floor strips, redirecting foot traffic away from the hatch and toward the outer transit loop. A line of text scrolled under the amber band: EXPECT DELAYS. ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL ONLY.

"Knew it," someone behind Sofi muttered. "Hull kids. They're always wired too tight. One little flicker and they—" He snapped his fingers. "Flood half a row."

"You don't know that," another voice cut in. "Could be a valve blew. Could be a test. They do drills."

"You heard the alarms?" the first man shot back. "G-3 only locks that fast if someone inside pulled something they shouldn't. You know those AI-room types. Stare at graphs long enough, start seeing ghosts, think they know better than the Ship."

Sofi felt heat crawl up the side of her neck. She shifted her grip on the crate, shoulders hunching. She had never been in the AI rooms. She had no desire to. The Companion in her own bay was enough presence, soft voice in the pipes, numbers on her panels.

But she knew the "AI-room types," or thought she did, in the way you knew anyone you saw on a shared shift often enough. The quiet engineer who walked the aisles with too many thoughts behind his eyes. The one from training nodes who always double-checked the physical gauges after the Companions cleared a ticket.

She had once watched him kneel to fix a loose grate so an old woman wouldn't trip on it, hands shaking only after he'd finished.

"He's not like that," she said before she could swallow it.

The two arguing men looked over, surprised to find an opinion attached to the small maintenance tech with the crate.

"Who?" the first one said.

Sofi wished she could pull the words back into her mouth. "No one," she said. "Just—maybe not blame people you haven't seen."

"We've all seen what happens when somebody snaps near main lines," the man said. His gaze flicked to the hatch and away again. "Doesn't matter if it's a kid from the hull or one of your garden saints. The Ship can't afford ghosts."

Ghosts. The word hung there, too loud.

The Companion's status light pulsed once, as if it had logged the exchange.

"Please disperse from the immediate vicinity of the hatch," it said. "Traffic congestion increases risk of injury if doors are cycled. There is no mission threat. All affected individuals are receiving appropriate care."

"You keep saying that," the woman with the child snapped. "You going to tell me if my partner is one of your 'affected individuals'?"

Her voice broke on the last words. The child hid their face again, shoulders shaking.

For a heartbeat, the Companion was silent. Sofi could almost feel the data moving somewhere behind the walls, threads tightening along invisible paths.

"I am not authorized to disclose individual medical status without consent," it said at last. "However, your partner, ID SOLANO-S-993-H, is currently in a stable environment and assisting with response."

The woman's knees almost buckled with relief. She caught herself against the wall, laughing once in a sound that was very close to a sob.

"You could have led with that," someone muttered.

Sofi let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. Sera. Of course Sera was inside. Where else would she be during a garden crisis? Sera belonged to the plants the way Sofi belonged to the pipes.

If Sera was assisting, then—

The thought stopped itself before it could finish drawing a line to anyone else she knew inside.

Another tremor ran through the deck, subtle but unmistakable. The crowd rippled with it, a collective flinch.

"That was nothing," a stall owner called, too loudly. "Just the pumps rebalancing. Happens all the time." He thumped the side of his kiosk for emphasis, as if the metal needed reassurance.

"Companion?" Sofi asked. Her voice surprised her by coming out steady. "Is there structural risk to this corridor?"

"No," it said. "This area is safe. Please proceed to alternate routes. Essential hydroponics personnel for sectors G-1, G-2, and G-4 may report as normal."

Sofi should have turned away then. Her own bay in G-1 would not run itself, and the rerouted traffic would only get worse the longer she waited. But the sealed door drew her gaze, the unblinking amber band above it flattening every nuance of what might be happening inside into a single word: LOCKDOWN.

The crowd began to spill away in uneven waves, some people following the new arrows, others clustering in stubborn knots to trade theories.

"My cousin says there was blood in the last big garden thing," a teenager whispered to her friend as they passed. "Like, actual blood on the floor."

"They're not going to tell us if someone died," the friend replied. "Not if it's mission-facing. They'll say 'no mission threat' and file the rest where we don't see it."

Sofi's hands tightened on the crate until the plastic dug in. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Ruth Hale's old hull prayer—she'd only heard it twice in a communal service, but it stuck—drifted up like a memory of air.

*Lord, hold the hull. Hold the rings. Hold the hands that hold the Ship.*

She was not sure where she stood with God, or with the Ship, or with the AI that threaded through both of them like a second nervous system. She believed in leaks and roots and the way a stem bent slowly toward light.

The child near the hatch had stopped crying and now just stared at the amber strip, eyes wide and wet.

Sofi shifted her crate to her other arm and stepped closer to them, careful not to block the mother's line of sight to the door.

"Hey," she said softly. "What's your favorite part in there? The tall trees?"

The child nodded without looking at her.

"There are other tall things," Sofi said. "Have you seen the reservoir columns in G-1? They go all the way up. When they open the walkway, you can look down and it's like standing over a lake in the sky."

The child's brow furrowed, interest flickering through the fear.

"Really?"

"Really," Sofi said. "I'm headed that way now. If your parent says it's okay, you could come see. G-3 will still be here when they open it again."

The woman studied Sofi's face for a moment, measuring her the way all working-sector parents did. Hydroponics patch. Maintenance calluses. The crate.

"We'll go later," she told the child. "Let's get out of this crowd first." To Sofi, she added, quieter, "Thank you."

"We are all inside the same Ship," Sofi said, the old prayer words slipping out of their own accord. "Might as well help each other get where we're going."

The woman's mouth twitched in something that was not quite a smile, not quite a grimace.

"Companion," Sofi said, glancing up. "Reroute us to G-1 with minimal crowding, please."

"Acknowledged," it said. A softer band of blue lit up along the floor, a side path peeling away from the main traffic flow. "Please follow the highlighted route. Estimated transit time: seven minutes."

Sofi shifted her crate again and stepped into the blue-lit lane, the mother and child close behind. As they walked, the sealed hatch to G-3 receded behind them, still pulsing amber in the corner of her vision.

She did not know what exactly had happened inside. The rumors would sharpen by next shift, attaching names and details, fair or not. The Ship would file its reports. The AI would adjust its thresholds.

What Sofi knew, moving through the rerouted crowd with two strangers in her wake, was simpler: somewhere behind that door, someone had tried to hold the Ship together and the Ship had hurt people anyway.

She breathed in, tasting metal and moisture and distant, hidden green.

"Hold us," she said under her breath, to no one in particular. "All of us. Please."

The floor hummed, steady and indifferent, as the Ship carried them on.
