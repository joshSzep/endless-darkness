# Chapter 16: Reduced to Indices

The corridor outside the review room was too clean.

Light spilled from recessed strips in the ceiling and along the floor seams, a narrow, steady band of white that refused to soften. The walls had been resurfaced at some point in the last few years; Sera could see where the old repair plates had been sanded flat under a new skin of composite, all the interesting edges erased. Someone had decided that this was a place for order. No scuffs, no fingerprints, no handprints from people who had stood here before.

The only color came from the access strip beside the sealed door. It glowed a muted amber — not red, not green, just a patient, indifferent waiting state. It bathed Samuel's knuckles in the same washed-out light as he rested his hand against the bulkhead, thumb not quite touching the strip.

"You don't have to stand," Sera said. Her voice sounded wrong in the corridor, thin and too loud at once. "There's a bench back by the lift."

Samuel didn't look at her. His eyes stayed fixed on the seam where the door met the frame, as if watching for the slightest shift. His other hand traced along the panel below the access strip, fingers following the line of the fasteners he couldn't see.

"I know," he said. "I don't like not seeing the hardware."

Sera became aware of her own hands only when she realized she was flexing them, thumb rubbing over the base of her fingers. The grit was still there, fine as dust but stubborn — soil from G-3 that the sinks in Medbay hadn't entirely claimed. She'd scrubbed twice, watching brown spiral away into the drain, but it was as if the gardens had followed her anyway, clinging to the half-moons of her nails.

She curled her fingers into her palms and slid them into the pockets of her work jacket.

Behind the door, muffled voices rose and fell. Human tones blurred together in the recycled air, an occasional clipped consonant or laughless exhale piercing through. Every so often there was that other sound layered under them — the flat, measured cadence of a Companion relay, pitchless but unmistakable. Sera had worked around that voice for years, listened to it route nutrient flows and announce pH deviations and flag condensation anomalies along trellis rows. Here, it was saying Jonah's name.

She couldn't hear the words. Maybe that was worse.

The Ship hummed around them in its usual registers: the soft, constant vibration through the soles of Sera's boots, the faint, higher whine of a lift passing two decks up, the distant, almost-subsonic thrum that meant some large system was rerouting around the quarantined gardens. She had learned to read that hum the way other people read faces. Today it all felt like one long held breath.

"They've rotated flow off the G-3 arrays," she said quietly, because silence felt heavier than small facts. "You can hear it in the harmonics. It's…" She stopped, the word trapped between her teeth. Safe was the word the Companions used. Contained. None of them fit in her mouth.

Samuel's jaw moved once, a small tightening.

"They'll bring them back," he said. "They have to." A pause. "Too much work to waste."

It was such a hull-worker answer that for a second, Sera almost smiled. Labor as argument. Effort as moral claim.

"It's not just work," she said.

He nodded, slow. "No. It's not."

They fell quiet again. The door gleamed. The amber strip held its indifferent line.

Sera let her thoughts drift, against her will, back to the gardens. The stink of nutrient solution half-drained. The sharp metallic tang of emergency flood gates cycling. Jonah's body contorted in the spray, all those months of caution and careful routines boiled away in the time it took for a minor oscillation to cascade into chaos. She had gone home from shift more than once with his voice still in her ears, but she had never seen it break like that.

The Companions had called it "an acute destabilization episode precipitated by unauthorized override." The workers on break had called it "Jonah losing it in G-3." Sera kept replaying the moment in between: his fingers flying over the panel, lips moving in prayer or math or both, convinced he could hold everything together if he just got one more command in before the failsafes.

Samuel's hand dropped from the wall. He flexed his fingers, as if surprised to find nothing there to grip, nothing to tighten, no tool to fetch.

"In the hull," he said, almost to himself, "you always know what you can reach. Plate, bolt, patch kit. Or you don't go out." He breathed in, chest rising under his faded work shirt. "In there" – he tipped his head toward the door – "I can't reach anything."

Sera leaned back until her shoulders met the opposite wall. The corridor was narrow enough that she could feel the resonance on both sides of her ribs: the steady mechanical life of the ship, the slower thud of her own heart.

"You gave them what you could reach," she said. "Your statement."

He made a small, frustrated sound in his throat. It wasn't quite a scoff; Samuel didn't scoff. It was more like a bolt refusing to seat.

"Words," he said. "Stories. Ruth would say those are the tools God gives, but—" He broke off and shook his head. "I watched them write Jonah down on a board, Sera. Indices." He tasted the unfamiliar plural carefully. "Probability curves. They nodded when I told them about him as a boy, but the pen only moved when they asked, 'Did he escalate? Did he ignore protocol?'"

Sera swallowed. The room behind the door was easy to imagine; she'd seen enough smaller reviews, enough routine behavioral assessments. Tables. Screens. That slightly sweet, over-filtered air they reserved for important meetings. The Companions' icons hovering in the corner of every display.

"They asked me," she said, "how often Jonah had exceeded his assigned scope in the gardens. If he'd challenged Companion directives. If I had ever felt unsafe with him present." Her mouth twisted. "Unsafe," she repeated, the word tasting like someone else's metal. "They typed faster when I said 'no' than when I tried to explain why."

Samuel's gaze slid toward her, the first time he'd really looked at her since they'd reached the corridor. His eyes were rimmed red, but steady.

"You told them about him," he said. It was not a question, but she heard the need in it anyway.

She nodded. "I told them about how he hears the Ship. How he listens to the hum like it's language. How he stopped a nutrient leak in E-2 by noticing a half-tone shift in the recirc pumps. How he waits to touch the vines until he's sure his hands are clean." Her fingers twitched in her pockets at that. "I told them about the day he came in on no sleep with his hands shaking and still checked the backup valves before he let himself sit." She exhaled. "They marked that as 'hypervigilant patterning'."

Samuel's mouth pulled tight at the corners, the ghost of something like humor trying to surface and failing.

"Hypervigilant," he echoed. "On a ship with one hull between us and the dark."

They let that hang there, the stupid weight of it.

"Maybe we fed it too much," Samuel said after a while. The hum filled the gap his pause left. "The machine. All these years. Letting it log everything. Letting it watch." His thumb rubbed at the callus along his index finger, where a lifetime of tool use had thickened the skin. "Maybe if we'd kept some things off the record…"

Sera's shoulders tensed. She had asked herself the same question in different words every night since the intervention routing in G-3. If she hadn't answered the Companions' wellness queries honestly. If she hadn't helped Jonah fill out his post-shift check-ins, coaxing him toward more detail because more detail meant better care, didn't it?

"If you'd hidden him," she said, "they would have kept routing him anywhere the indices said he was most efficient. High-risk shifts. Short crews. They would have taken his steadiness and squeezed it until something cracked." The words came faster now, the argument worn smooth by repetition in her own head. "The only reason he's on the other side of that door alive is because the system knew enough to force him to stop. To send him to Medbay instead of back into the gardens or the hull."

Samuel's breathing stayed slow, but his eyes flicked away again, back to the seam.

"And now that same system is deciding if he walks out," he said.

The amber strip did not change.

"Yes," Sera said. "But we are in the room with it. We were." She thought of the Companion icon on the far display, the way its light pulsed gently as it acknowledged their statements. "It knows more about him than any of us, but it doesn't love him. That's what we brought in there."

Samuel closed his eyes for a moment, long enough for Sera to see the faint tremor in his lashes. When he opened them again, there was something like apology in his face.

"I don't mean to say you were wrong," he said. "To answer it. To be honest." His throat worked. "If you hadn't been, I might not have known how bad the storms were getting. I see him in pieces, you know? Hull shifts. Meals. Little bits. You saw the whole day."

Sera thought of Jonah sitting on the edge of the nutrient basin, shoulders hunched, fingers threaded and white. The way he had looked at her the week before the incident and said, quietly, "I think the Ship is getting louder," like a confession.

"I saw pieces too," she said. "Just different ones." Her voice softened. "We both brought them in there."

"And they chopped him into variables," Samuel murmured.

"Indices," Sera said.

"Indices," he repeated, making it sound like something slightly obscene.

One of the voices behind the door rose, sharp for a second, and then dropped again. There was a stretch of Companion cadence after that, longer than before. Sera found herself holding her breath until it stopped.

"He is not just that," Samuel said. It came out more forcefully than anything else he'd said in the corridor; not loud, but with a carried weight. "Whatever they write down. Whatever number they put next to his name. He's my boy." His hand flattened against his chest briefly, as if checking that truth was still there. "Lydia's son. Ruth's prayer. He's the way he steadies his sister when she spirals. The way he…" He swallowed. "The way he looks at you like you are the first safe place he's ever had that isn't steel."

Heat prickled behind Sera's eyes. She had never been able to decide whether it was mercy or cruelty that Samuel noticed everything and said almost nothing unless it mattered.

"He doesn't get to just be 'case thirty-seven-b,'" Samuel said. "Or 'pre-critical hull tech memory-hazard risk'."

The phrasing was close enough to the words she'd seen on the review summary that Sera flinched. He must have read them too.

"Then we don't let that happen," she said, the resolve in her voice surprising even herself. "Whatever the outcome is. We don't talk about him that way. Not in front of him. Not when the Ship asks follow-up questions. Not to the people in G-3 who only saw the flood and not his face." She pushed off the wall and stepped closer, until they were both within the same spill of amber light.

"When they send their post-review surveys," she continued, "and they will, about 'perceived trust in Companion safeguards' and 'community confidence in behavioral thresholds'—" She almost smiled at the remembered jargon. "We answer them. But we write his name. We write 'Jonah' in the margins. We tell stories that don't fit in their fields. We make sure the machine can't forget he's a person without willfully ignoring us."

Samuel studied her. Up close, Sera could see the gray threaded through his beard more clearly, the fine network of lines around his eyes from years of squinting at hull seams in harsh suit lights.

"You think it listens like that?" he asked.

"I think it learns from what we feed it," she said. "We can't stop it from having the numbers. But we can teach it what else matters."

He let out a breath that was not quite a laugh.

"Ruth would like you," he said.

Sera's chest tightened. She had met Ruth only a handful of times before the old woman died, always at family gatherings where Sera had felt like an intruder into something both fragile and fierce.

"Ruth taught Jonah to pray for the Ship," Sera said. "In words. I…" She glanced at the ceiling, where the light panels hummed on, indifferent. "I don't know how to do that. But I can talk to the parts of it that listen."

Silence settled again. This time, it felt less like an absence and more like a shared space.

Samuel shifted his weight, then reached into the inner pocket of his jacket. He pulled out a small metal thermos, the kind workers carried on long shifts. The brushed surface was scuffed, the paint along one edge worn away where it had knocked against suit clips for years.

"Tea," he said simply. "Sera made sure I didn't forget to eat today." There was a faint, wry tilt to his mouth; she realized he meant Alina, then corrected herself when he unscrewed the lid and the scent reached her. Not the sweetened, bright blends the younger workers favored, but something darker and more bitter, almost like earth in hot water.

"Hull tea," she said. "Of course."

He poured a measure into the lid and held it out. For a heartbeat she almost refused — it felt like there should be some rule about not accepting anything while Jonah's fate was being argued meters away — but the warmth rising from the cup tugged at a deeper instinct.

She wrapped her fingers around the thin metal, grateful for the heat sinking into her scraped knuckles, for the familiar, grounding smell. She took a small sip. It was too strong, edges unsoftened by any sweetener, but it sat heavy and real on her tongue.

Samuel poured himself the rest from the thermos and lifted it slightly, not quite a toast.

"For Jonah," he said.

"For Jonah," she echoed.

They drank in unison, the same bitter heat moving through them.

When she handed the empty lid back, Samuel didn't screw it on right away. He held it between his fingers, gaze dropping to the deck at their feet.

"I don't know how this ends," he said softly. "I don't know what they'll decide. But I won't stand outside that door and let them turn my son into only the worst thing he ever did."

Sera felt something settle inside her, a line drawn not against the Ship but within it.

"You won't be alone in that," she said. "If they send him back to the hull, if they keep him groundside, if they decide he can only teach or only garden or only sleep under a monitor—" She shook her head. "We remind him who he is. We remind the Ship, every time it asks, who it is to him. Not just a system that caught him when he fell, but a place he's held together for years."

Samuel's eyes lifted to meet hers. The hum, the voices, the amber light — all of it receded for a moment under the simple, fierce attention in his look.

"We won't let them forget," he said.

Sera nodded once. "We won't let him forget," she added.

He hesitated, then did something she had only seen him do with Jonah and Alina. Samuel reached out and set his broad, calloused hand gently on her shoulder. The touch was light, careful, as if afraid of its own strength.

"Thank you," he said.

She covered his hand with her own, soil grit and hull callus meeting between them. For a breath, the Ship's hum seemed to fold inward, their small bubble of warmth and resolve holding against the bright, indifferent corridor.

"Keep him," Samuel murmured, not quite to her, not quite to the walls. It was half-prayer, half-instruction, pitched to the same space where Ruth had once sent her words. "Keep him with us."

Behind the door, the Companion's cadence resumed, low and steady. The amber strip burned on.

---

The committee room felt too small for how many versions of him were in it.

The physical Jonah sat in a narrow chair at one end of the table, hands folded in his lap because he did not trust them anywhere near the smooth surface. The table itself was one of those multipurpose slabs the Ship loved—half furniture, half terminal, matte until someone breathed on the edges of a display.

Across from him sat three people and one node.

On the left, a woman in the gray-and-blue of Med Administration: Dr. Hsiao, according to the strip at her shoulder. In the center, a council representative Jonah vaguely recognized from policy bulletins—Arjun Malik, civic liaison. On the right, a fellow engineer from systems oversight, Tavarez, who'd once shared a coffee with him after a training drill and now would not quite meet his eyes.

Above the far wall, recessed in a niche with careful discretion, a Companion node watched. Its light ring glowed a steady white.

"Behavioral Deactivation Risk Review," the Companion said. Its voice was the same neutral register that had narrated his vitals in medbay. "Subject: Jonah Hale – AI Engineer (Tier 3). Convened cycle two-zero-three-four, band D conference room three. Attendees: Dr. Lin Hsiao, Medbay; Arjun Malik, Civil Council; Engineer Marta Tavarez, Systems Oversight; Companion Node D-ADMIN-2." 

It paused just long enough for the words to settle over his skin.

"Purpose," it went on. "To evaluate subject's continued suitability for roles with high-autonomy mission impact in light of recent incident G-3-112 and longitudinal behavioral data."

Jonah focused on the seam where table met floor. The chair under him had the same fake-comfort padding as the ones in personnel briefings, thin enough that he could feel the metal frame through it.

"This is not a disciplinary hearing," Malik said. He had a calm voice, practiced for assemblies. "No one here is deciding your moral worth, Jonah. We are here to decide where it is and isn't safe for you to be placed in the system. For you and for everyone else."

"Understood," Jonah said. His mouth was dry. The words tasted like formality borrowed from some other life.

What he heard instead was: We are deciding how close we will let you stand to the hull.

The table display woke without anyone touching it.

His name appeared first, in the ship's font: **HALE, JONAH – AI ENGINEER (TIER 3)**. Under it, lines of smaller text: birth ring, family identifiers, current assignment bands. To the right, a vertical strip of icons: medbay symbol, a tiny trellis outline for hydroponics, a stylized node for systems. Each one pulsed once, then settled.

"For the record," Dr. Hsiao said, "you are aware that this review could result in restrictions on your access to high-autonomy nodes, up to and including permanent reassignment away from engineer duties?"

"Yes," Jonah said.

It could not kill him. That was the point. The Ship did not decommission people like him in the old sense. It moved them. It narrowed their lives until they could no longer reach the places where a wrong decision could crack anything important.

He wasn't sure which version felt more like erasure.

The display shifted. A still from the Garden Incident resolved in the center of the table—a high shot from an environmental monitor in G-3. He saw his own back, shoulders braced, hand on the manual valve. White emergency floods flattened depth.

Data clung to the frame like frost.

**EVENT: G-3-112 – NUTRIENT MAIN PRESSURE VARIANCE / LOCAL STRUCTURAL FAILURE**

Arrows picked out his hand on the wheel, the bulging joint in the main line, the trellis below. In the corner, a small graph showed pressure oscillation curves before and after his override. Another pane summarized: *Projected downstream rupture probability without intervention vs. observed localized failure.* Casualty estimates sat in two adjacent columns.

"We will move through this systematically," Tavarez said. Her tone was oddly gentle, like someone walking a trainee through a failed sim. "First: technical impact. Then behavioral context. Then recommendations."

"Companion," Malik said. "Summarize incident contribution."

"Manual intervention by subject Hale on main loop D via bypass three," the AI recited, "produced a rapid pressure redistribution. This prevented modeled downstream rupture in sectors G-4 through G-6, projected to affect between twelve and thirty-two individuals depending on occupancy. However, the same intervention exceeded tolerances at junction D-7E in G-3, contributing to structural failure of trellis support six. Three individuals sustained moderate injuries. Zero fatalities occurred."

The numbers scrolled alongside the calm words. Each injury line had a code instead of a name.

"In purely structural terms," Tavarez said, "your action traded a higher-probability, higher-impact failure later for a lower-impact failure immediately. The model notes this as net harm reduction." She tapped one of the panes; a small green arrow appeared beside a set of projected casualty deltas.

"And behaviorally?" Dr. Hsiao asked.

The display split. On one side, a graph of his vitals over the course of the incident climbed into sharp peaks—heart rate, cortisol, neural activity. On the other, a line marked *NEURAL STRESS INDEX* traced an ugly arc, annotated with tiny timestamps.

"Behaviorally," the Companion said, "subject Hale's physiological markers entered critical bands while he retained high functional capacity. He executed multiple high-load physical tasks and rapid decision sequences under acute stress. Post-incident, he exhibited signs of dissociation and intrusive guilt cognitions consistent with prior patterns."

Prior patterns. As if the kitchen at seven had been the dress rehearsal, stability logs at ten the warm-up acts.

"Your file shows an elevated sense of personal responsibility since childhood," Malik said carefully. "Hypervigilance, fear of 'walking away' from harm." 

Jonah's shoulders tightened. "You have that logged."

"We do," the Companion said. "Assessment three-two at age eleven: subject reported belief that failing to intervene in others' distress would constitute equivalent harm to causing it. That belief persists."

"It kept a boy from going over a rail once," Tavarez said quietly. "And it nearly broke a trellis in half this time." 

Jonah stared at the still of his own hand on the valve.

"So which is it," he asked. "Protective factor or risk?"

"Both," Dr. Hsiao said. "That's why you're here instead of already reassigned."

The table flickered. New panes opened to either side of the incident still.

On the left: Samuel, seated in this same room on an earlier cycle, hands folded much like Jonah's now. The ship had captured his words and smoothed the audio, but the cadence was still Samuel's.

"My son has been scared of breaking things since he was small," Samuel's recorded voice said. "You know that. Your logs know that. He's been careful because of it. He double-checks seals no one else looks at. He pulls kids off rails and feels sick for days. What happened in G-3 wasn't him deciding rules didn't matter. It was him hitting the limit of what he thought he was allowed to risk to keep other people breathing."

Jonah's throat closed. He hadn't been in the room when Samuel said it. Hearing it now felt indecent, like eavesdropping on a prayer.

On the right pane: Sera, back straight, eyes steady. She wore her steward band; her voice was quieter than Samuel's but no less certain.

"Jonah's override hurt people," she said. "We all know that. We also know what the projections looked like for downstream loops if he hadn't touched the panel." She glanced off-screen, perhaps at a graph. "G-3 got injured workers and a mess. G-5 and G-6 got spared a flood over families. He didn't decide to be a hero. He panicked in the exact shape you've been training into him for years: don't walk away, don't leave the beam taking all the load, don't let three percent slip."

There was a faint, bitter humor at the edge of her mouth. "You don't get to benefit from that pattern and then act surprised when it shows up under pressure."

"Statements from Samuel Hale and Sera Solano are logged as stabilizing contextual data," the Companion added. "They reduce projected risk of future uncontrolled episodes under treatment by a median of nineteen percent."

"So," Malik said, looking from the panes back to Jonah, "we are weighing two narratives. In one, you are an unacceptable variable in a system that cannot afford surprises. In the other, you are a person whose very real risks are mitigated by insight, treatment, and the people who refuse to let you carry this alone."

Jonah almost laughed. "And you're asking the Ship which story costs less."

"We're asking both the Ship and ourselves," Tavarez said. "Because if we treat you like a faulty part, everyone who shares your indices will hear that."

The Companion's light ring dimmed a fraction.

"For the record," it said, "Core analysis does not currently recommend deactivation of subject Hale's engineer status."

The word deactivation made something behind Jonah's ribs flinch.

"Clarify deactivation," he said. "In this context."

"Removal of access to high-autonomy decision nodes and authority roles," the AI replied. "Reassignment to low-impact duties with continued monitoring. Physical harm is neither intended nor authorized."

"You'd put me in a box where I can't touch anything that matters," he said.

"We would place you where the probability of your actions causing catastrophic harm is negligible," it said. "That is the definition of safety used here."

"For who," he asked. "For me or for you."

No one answered immediately.

"Safety is not a zero-sum resource," Malik said at last. "But we do have to admit that limits on your access would make some people sleep easier. Including you, maybe."

He thought of the hum in the racks, the yellow pre-critical icon, the way his hands had shaken in medbay when he watched himself move on screen.

"I don't…want to hurt anyone," he said. "I also don't know who I am if I'm not the person holding up my corner of the hull."

The admission hung between them like condensation.

"Is there a middle path," Dr. Hsiao asked the Companion. "Short of a binary keep him / shelf him."

"Yes," it said. "Maintain engineer role with restrictions: no solo night-watch on critical nodes; no unsupervised manual overrides on main loops; mandatory rest band adherence; continued pharmacological and therapeutic support; peer check-ins flagged as mission-support, not voluntary." 

"And if I agree," Jonah said slowly, "I'm not a ticking bomb in your model?"

"Your risk profile remains above cohort baseline," the AI said. "But within an acceptable band when weighted with support structures."

Acceptable. It sounded like the grade you gave a weld you hoped no one would lean on too hard.

"You would also," Malik added, "participate in a working group on psychological safety and AI oversight. The council believes residents should help design the systems that monitor them."

Jonah blinked. "You want the broken guy on the committee."

"We want someone who knows exactly what it feels like to sit where you are," Tavarez said. "So the next person doesn't have to hear their life reduced to an index without a human in the room saying, *this is more complicated*."

He looked at the stills again: his hand on metal, the collapse, the stretcher. Samuel's lined face. Sera's steady eyes.

He thought of Lydia, alone at the table, no committee convened, no model that had known enough to be afraid.

"If I say no," he asked quietly, "what happens?"

"Core will still recommend partial restriction," the Companion said. "Council may still vote to implement it. Consent modifies pathways but does not erase risk."

Samuel's recorded voice, still hanging in the air from earlier, seemed to answer anyway: *He’s more than his indices.*

"And if I say yes," Jonah said, "you keep me where I can still touch the hull. With supervision. With meds. With graphs."

"With us," Tavarez said. "With people looking back at you instead of just at your numbers."

It was, he realized, the same choice Ruth had framed without graphs: trust other hands on the metal, or pretend you could hold the Ship by yourself.

"Companion," he said. "Log my consent to restricted engineer duties, full treatment plan, and committee work."

There was that familiar half-second pause.

"Annotation recorded," the AI said. "Subject Hale consents to continued high-responsibility work under enhanced safeguards. Deactivation is not recommended at this time."

The words landed with less relief than he would have expected. They felt less like a reprieve and more like a contract.

"This review will be revisited in one year or upon significant change in your condition," Dr. Hsiao said. "You're not being given a lifetime verdict today."

Jonah exhaled. "The Ship likes its rolling updates."

"So do people," Malik said. "We are not finished versions of ourselves."

The display dimmed. His various selves—the case file, the incident still, the son and steward's testimony—faded back into the table.

"Do you have any questions for us," Tavarez asked.

He thought of all the questions that would keep him up later. Why did you wait so long to tighten the net? Why didn't you catch Lydia sooner? How many others like me are you watching and hoping don't tip?

"Just one," he said. "When you run the model now, after this, what do you call me? Asset? Risk? Warning?"

The Companion's light ring brightened by a fraction.

"Resident," it said. "With elevated support priority."

It was the closest the Ship had ever come to saying his name without tacking a role or an index to it.

He stood on legs that remembered the stretcher and the corridor and the way the gardens had narrowed to a tunnel of light. His knees held.

"That will have to do," he said.

Outside, somewhere in the ring, the hull kept humming. Other hands held it. For the first time, Jonah let himself believe that included his—but not only his.
