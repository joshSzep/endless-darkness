# Chapter 18: Managed Days

The first sound was the hum.

Not alarms, not shouting, not the slam of doors sealing. Just the steady, layered noise of the apartment pod breathing: air through vents, water cycling in the wall, the distant thrum of the maglev two decks over. Jonah lay on his back and listened to it sort itself into separate threads.

He counted three before he opened his eyes.

The ceiling above his bunk was the same off-white panel it had always been. A hairline crack ran from one corner of the access hatch toward the light strip, a tiny fault he'd noticed years ago and checked against structural codes more times than he could count. It hadn't grown.

The light at the edge of the door glowed dim blue: pre-shift.

"Good morning, Jonah," the apartment Companion said, soft from the wall node near the kitchenette. "Cycle two-zero-three-one, ring D. Scheduled wake window: open."

His mouth felt dry. His thoughts did not race to meet him. They arrived in an orderly line, one after another, as if someone had put foam around the edges.

"Medication window: open," the Companion added. "Would you like a reminder of dosage?"

"I remember," he said.

His voice sounded rough, but not strained. He lay there one more breath, then swung his legs over the side of the bunk. His feet found the cool, slightly tacky surface of the floor mat.

No surge of adrenaline. No sense that the room had shrunk while he slept. Just stiffness in his shoulders and the faint, cotton-wrapped dullness behind his eyes that he was still learning to call normal.


The tiny table in the main room held three things: a chipped mug, a folded cloth, and the pill case.

The case was transparent, segmented into little compartments labeled with Samuel's neat, blocky handwriting: **MORNING**, **MID**, **EVENING**. Beneath each, the sharp corners of tablets pressed against plastic. A note lay beside it, written on the back of an old maintenance tag.

*You are not a problem to solve. More than your indices. Love, Dad.*

Jonah picked up the note, thumb smoothing over the crease where Samuel had folded it in half. The words still made something in his chest tighten and loosen at the same time.

He set it down and opened the **MORNING** compartment.

Two pills, one small and white, one oblong and pale blue. They were so little. They looked like nothing. They looked like everything his life had narrowed to, the weeks in medbay distilled into milligrams.

"Recommended intake with food," the Companion said mildly. "Full glass of water."

"I'm getting there," he muttered.

He filled the mug at the sink, the water coming out with the familiar faint metallic tang of ship pipes. Samuel kept a cloth over the spout to "catch dust," though there was nowhere for dust to come from.

Jonah swallowed the pills one at a time, chasing them with water. They went down without protest, lodging for just a second in his awareness before sliding into the anonymous space of his stomach.

A soft chime came from the wall.

"Medication compliance logged," the Companion said. "Thank you."

"Feels like a behavior chart," Jonah said.

"Charts can be useful for tracking progress," it replied.

He made a face at the node and set the mug down a little harder than necessary.


Samuel emerged from the sleeping alcove a few minutes later, hair still damp, sleeves rolled to his forearms. He'd put on his lighter work coverall, the one with fewer scuffs at the knees. Semi-retirement had shifted him from full hull runs to local inspections and mentoring, but he still moved like someone who expected metal to grunt at him any second.

"Morning," he said.

"Morning," Jonah replied.

Samuel's gaze flicked to the pill case, saw the open morning compartment, then to Jonah's face. He didn't comment on either.

"You sleep?" Samuel asked instead.

"Some," Jonah said. "Enough."

"Dreams?" Samuel's tone stayed casual.

"Nothing with ruptures," Jonah said. "Just…strange. Like walking through the hull corridors with all the lights dimmed one notch. I could still see my boots."

Samuel nodded once, as if that was the exact right amount of strange.

"I'll take that over nothing," he said. He crossed to the small counter and started the kettle. "You hear the Ship humming this morning?"

"I noticed," Jonah said.

"Good," Samuel said. "Means we're both still here."

He said it the way other people said blessings.

They ate in comfortable near-silence: lentils reheated from the night before, a sliver of preserved fruit Ruth had sent from a friend in another sector, thick slices of nutrient bread. Samuel bowed his head briefly before they started, hand resting on the table between them.

"For breath, for metal that holds, for minds that mend," he murmured.

Jonah hesitated half a beat, then added his own quiet: "For people who stay."

Samuel's mouth twitched upward, lines around his eyes deepening.

"Amen," he said.


When Jonah stepped into the corridor, the Ship's noise rose around him.

The residential band felt narrower than the big training rings but wider than the hull corridors. Families moved in loose streams toward lifts and stairs, children tugging at sleeves, adults checking wrist displays and murmur-synced Companion updates. The light strips along the ceiling held steady at false morning.

He tugged his jacket a little closer and joined the flow.

His assignment for the cycle blinked on his wrist: **TRAINING SUPPORT – AI SYSTEMS, RING C-EDU 4**. Not direct access to processing nodes. Not independent maintenance. A classroom.

He wasn't sure how he felt about that.

"Reduced-autonomy access has been effective in similar cases," the review Companion had said, back in the small committee room. "It allows continued contribution while decoupling acute episodes from high-risk control surfaces."

"Similar cases," Jonah muttered under his breath now. "That's me. A data point in their nice little cluster."

"You are also Jonah," the apartment Companion had told him. He shook his head to clear it.

The lift ride was short. The car didn't stall. The lights didn't flicker.

Halfway through the ride, the panel above the door pulsed once.

"Jonah," the local Companion said. "How would you rate your mood in the last twelve hours? One being very low, five being very stable."

"Three," he said, after a brief internal check.

"Any intrusive thoughts of self-harm or harm to others?" it continued.

"No," he said. The word tasted honest.

"Any hallucinations since last check-in?" it asked.

He thought of the way the emergency floods had erased the gardens, the echo of his own name under the footage. Those were memories, not ghosts.

"No," he said again.

"Thank you," it replied. "Survey complete."

The car chimed gently and opened onto the education ring.


The training room smelled like cleanser and young nerves.

Rows of consoles faced a blank wall where simulations would project. A dozen trainees in gray sat scattered, some hunched over displays, others spinning idly in their chairs. A Companion node sat above the door, light ring dim.

Instructor Vale stood at the front, arms folded. When Jonah stepped in, her gaze flicked to him, held for a moment, then dropped back to her tablet.

"Hale," she said. "Good. You remember what the inside of this place looks like."

"Hard to forget," he said.

A few of the trainees glanced back at him, curiosity flickering in their faces. He's the one, he imagined them thinking. The one from the rumors. The one the Ship had to sedate in the gardens.

Vale rapped her knuckles lightly on the console.

"Eyes front," she said. "This is Jonah Hale. Some of you know him from before. Some of you know his work without knowing his face. Today he's here to help walk you through failure modes in manual overrides and why you should listen to procedure even when your brain tells you the Ship is wrong."

There was a small rustle of amusement.

"I have lived experience," Jonah said dryly.

That got a real laugh from at least two of them. The knot in his chest eased by a fraction.


By mid-cycle, he was tired in a different way than before.

His thoughts didn't skid from one scenario to another. They stayed where he put them, on diagrams of loop D and bypass three, on the difference between a flagged oscillation and a silent one. When someone asked a question that touched too close to his own incident, he felt the memory rise, hot and sharp, then settle when he named it.

"In theory," he said, pointing at the projected schematic, "this is a textbook damp. In practice, you don't perform it alone, you don't bypass authorization because you're afraid of twelve hypothetical minutes, and you definitely don't do it while your Companion is calling you pre-critical."

He heard Instructor Vale suck in a breath behind him and realized he'd said the last part out loud.

"The main point," he added, "is that the Ship is big enough to hold your fear and your caution. You're not the only hand on the valve."

After the session, one of the trainees—a girl with a worry line between her brows that reminded him of Alina—hung back.

"Sir," she said, then flushed. "Jonah. Did it feel...different? Before you knew you needed help?"

"Yes," he said. There was no point lying. "But it also felt like me. That was the hardest part."

"And now?" she asked.

He considered.

"Now it feels like me with a buffer," he said. "Still mine. Just...less likely to crack the pipes."

She nodded like that was enough. For today, it was.


He met Sera in the corridor outside hydroponics.

The sector door cycled open for her palm. Humidity rolled out in a wave, carrying the familiar green smell. She stepped through, then turned and held it a little longer so he could stay in the drier threshold.

"Support overlap: eighteen minutes," the corridor Companion announced. "Sera Solano. Jonah Hale."

"Subtle," Sera said, glancing up. "Thank you for the romance, Ship."

"Scheduling efficiencies," the Companion said.

Jonah snorted.

"How's version three-point-one?" she asked him, leaning against the doorframe.

"Laggy at startup," he said. "Fewer fatal errors."

She smiled, slow and genuine. "You still sound like you. Just with less static." She tipped her head. "Side effects?"

"Dry mouth. Heavy arms," he said. "The Ship feels...farther away. In a good way. Like someone's turned the volume down on the part of my brain that thinks every hum is a countdown."

"I'll take that," she said.

He looked past her into the rows. The sector was quiet, between volunteer shifts. Emergency floods were off; the light was back to its warm, plant-colored wash. The trellis in row six had been replaced. New supports, new piping, leaves already finding their way up.

"Any new kiosks?" he asked.

"They left the self-assessment station," she said. "I made my peace with it." She paused. "I use it sometimes."

He blinked.

"You?" he said.

"I'm a person too," she said. "Shocking, I know. Turns out having your partner sedated in your workplace is stressful."

"I'm sorry," he said automatically.

"I'm not fishing," she said. "I'm saying the Ship wasn't wrong about routing you here. It just forgot I might need help too. I'm reminding it."

He let that sit between them.

"Want to put your hands in something that isn't data?" she asked. "We've got a new batch of peppers that think they're vines."

"I'm banned from unsupervised peppers," he said.

"Good thing you'll be supervised," she replied.

He stepped inside. The air wrapped around him, thick and damp. His skin prickled, ready for old associations—emergency floods, ruptured mains, his own voice yelling at the Ship.

Nothing else happened.

He followed Sera down a row, let her press a tangle of stems into his hands, listened as she talked about root systems and nutrient mixes. The pumps hummed. Fans turned. Somewhere overhead, a valve clicked in a perfectly ordinary way.

He noticed the sounds. He did not feel the world tilt.

"That's new," he said quietly.

"What is?" she asked.

"I heard every noise," he said. "And my body stayed where it was."

"File a compliment with your prescriber," she said.

"I might," he said.


By the time he rode the lift back to Samuel's ring, his muscles ached pleasantly from ordinary work. Tired, not wrung out.

The lift paused once between decks as another car crossed the junction. The lights dimmed a single degree to compensate.

His lungs tightened on reflex, just for a heartbeat.

He closed his eyes.

*Lord, hold the hull,* he thought, not in panic this time but out of habit. *Hold the rings. Hold the hands that hold the Ship.*

He matched the words to his breath: in on "hold," out on "Ship." Six cycles. By the time he finished, the car had resumed its climb.

No surge. No tunnel vision. Just a faint echo of what used to be.

"Transit complete," the Companion said as the doors opened.


In the apartment, the light had shifted toward evening.

Samuel sat in his usual chair, tablet in hand, reading some old hull log. He looked up when Jonah came in.

"How'd it go?" he asked.

"Didn't break any trainees," Jonah said. "Or pipes."

"High bar," Samuel said gravely.

Jonah's wrist buzzed. A message icon blinked from Alina.

He sank onto the bunk before opening it.

The recording loaded with a tiny delay. Alina's face appeared, hair pulled back, a smudge of something dark at her temple that might have been paint or grease.

"Hey," she said. "Heard you survived another day of being Responsible and Stable." She waggled her fingers in the air to frame the capital letters. "Proud of you. Also mildly resentful the Ship never gave me a pillbox." She sobered a fraction. "Seriously, though. If you ever feel too muffled, you tell someone before you decide to adjust your own dose like an idiot. Love you."

The message ended on an unflattering freeze-frame of her mid-eye-roll.

Jonah snorted.

"She all right?" Samuel asked.

"Opinionated as ever," Jonah said.

He sent a quick reply: *Still me. Just less likely to flood your art studio by accident. Love you too.*


That night, when he lay down, the hum was still there.

He didn't try to silence it. He let it be what it was: air, water, spin, power. The evidence of millions of parts doing their jobs so no one had to think about them.

He matched his breathing to it—not perfectly, not obsessively. Just enough to feel the world and his chest moving on roughly the same beat.

Terror hadn't left. It sat where it always had, somewhere behind his ribs, a small, patient knot of what-ifs. But it was no longer driving his hands to valves.

For the first time in a long time, that felt like enough.

He closed his eyes on the familiar ceiling crack and let the Ship hum him toward sleep.

---

The bench had always been there, a simple strip of composite bolted to the wall opposite the G-3 access arch. Jonah had sat on it a hundred times over the years, half-listening to shift-change chatter while Sera scrubbed soil from her fingers or traded jokes with other stewards. It had been part of the background hum of his life, as dependable and featureless as the panel seams.

Now the bench felt like a spotlight.

He sat with his back against the cool wall, hands wrapped loosely around a dented mug of post-shift broth. The corridor smelled faintly of wet leaves and sanitizer, the ghosts of the flood still lingering no matter how many times the Companions cycled the air. The G-3 doors loomed a few meters away, their surface freshly resurfaced, the access strip glowing a calm, institutional green.

People moved past in little knots: stewards coming off rotation, families cutting through to the tram, a pair of nursery kids tugging at each other’s sleeves until a companion voice from the ceiling reminded them to mind the rail. Most of them glanced at the doors. Some glanced at him.

"Too much?" Sera asked softly.

She sat at the far end of the bench, angled toward the corridor, elbows on her knees. Her hands were empty; she’d finished her broth already and set the mug on the floor between her boots. The damp cuffs of her work pants were flecked with dried nutrient solution. Her hair was tied back in a knot that had started neat and surrendered somewhere around mid-shift.

"It's fine," Jonah said. His voice came out steady enough. The Companions would have marked it as within expected range.

"Fine," Sera repeated, but she didn't push. "We can go if you want. It's just a bench."

Just a bench, he thought, that has watched more of my life than some people.

A group of stewards clustered near the doors, waiting for the next crew to clear. Sofi was among them, her dark hair pulled under a net, sleeves rolled up past her elbows. She saw Jonah, hesitated, then raised a hand in a small, awkward wave.

He nodded back, a tiny tilt of his mug. Her shoulders eased by a degree. She said something to the steward next to her — a man Jonah didn't know well — and the man glanced over too. For a second Jonah braced for the look he’d seen before the medbay: pity, or fear, or that tight, controlled curiosity people got when they were trying to decide whether to ask about the incident.

Instead the man squinted and said, loud enough to carry, "You the one who caught the E-2 valve fault last year?"

The words hit Jonah like a soft impact.

"Uh," he said. "I was on that shift."

"Yeah." The man snapped his fingers once. "You yelled at the Companion because it wanted to keep the flow at nominal when the tone was wrong. Sofi told us." He jerked his chin toward the doors. "You saved my cousin’s rotation. That leak would’ve ruined half her row."

Heat crept up Jonah's neck. Sera’s head turned slightly, watching him but not interfering.

"It wasn’t just me," Jonah said. "The sensor flagged—"

"Sensor flagged late," Sofi cut in. "You heard it first."

There was a small murmur of agreement from the group. Someone else added, "Ship’s got good ears, but some of us have better." There was a ripple of tired laughter.

The moment passed. The doors cycled; the next crew filed through, boots leaving faint damp prints on the deck. Sofi gave Jonah one more quick look — not avoidance, not fascination, just recognition — and followed the others inside.

Jonah realized his grip on the mug had tightened. He forced his fingers to loosen.

"That was not how I expected that to go," he said.

"Me neither," Sera said. "Sofi can surprise you."

Another family passed: a woman with a sleeping toddler slumped against her shoulder, a teen dragging a crate on a little grav-sled behind them. The teen's eyes flicked to Jonah, lingered on the thin scar along his wrist where the medbay line had gone in, then slid away. No whisper. No pointing. Just the ordinary cataloguing of someone measuring the world.

"You don't have to catalog every glance," Sera murmured, as if reading his mind.

"Ship catalogs worse," Jonah said.

"Ship logs," she corrected. "You catalog. There's a difference."

He wanted to argue, but the words scattered before he could catch them. He took a sip of broth instead. It had gone lukewarm, the flavor a familiar blend of salt and something protein-adjacent. The warmth spread through his throat in a thin line, not quite reaching his chest.

A Companion announcement crackled softly from the overhead panel.

"Hydroponics sectors G-1 through G-4: post-incident safeguards review completed. Updated access tiers and emergency protocols now in effect. For details, please consult your sector schedules or speak to your supervising steward. Mission risk remains within acceptable parameters. Community risk support available upon request."

The voice did not say his name. It didn't have to. Conversations around the corridor dipped for a heartbeat, then resumed. Someone muttered, "There it is," under their breath. Someone else replied, "At least they finished before next planting."

Sera blew out a slow breath through her nose.

"Hate that phrase," she said.

"Which one?" Jonah asked. "Safeguards? Acceptable parameters? Community risk support?"

"Community risk support," she said. "Like we're all just indices." Her shoulder brushed his as she shifted, a small, grounding contact. "You want to go see the trellises after they reopen, or wait a few days?"

"I don't know yet," he said honestly.

"That's allowed," she said.

A pair of older workers he recognized from before the incident slowed as they neared the bench. One of them — Kira, with the line of old chemical burns along her left forearm — tipped her head toward Jonah.

"Hey," she said. "We’re short a set of ears on the C-2 pumps next week. Not yours," she added quickly, seeing his shoulders tense. "Just… if you feel up to walking the row with us. No panels. Just listening."

The offer hung there, simple and enormous.

"No pressure," her companion added. "We’ve got it covered. Just thought… you might like to hear something that isn’t a med monitor for a change."

Jonah's throat closed around the immediate surge of answer — yes, yes, I miss the pumps, I miss the way the Ship sings when it’s behaving. He forced himself to breathe.

"I'll think about it," he said.

"Thinking’s good," Kira said. "Ship could use more of it." She lifted two fingers in a casual salute and moved on.

Sera watched them go, then turned back to Jonah.

"You can say no," she reminded him.

"I know," he said. He stared into his mug. "I don't want them to…" He groped for the word. "To have to work around me."

"We're all working around each other," she said. "Around the Ship. Around the Companions. Around our own storms." She nudged his knee with hers. "You deserve to choose what you work around, too."

The announcement panel pinged again, this time in a softer tone.

"Post-incident wellness surveys are available for completion," the Companion said. "Your feedback helps us improve safeguards and support."

Jonah huffed a breath that was not quite a laugh.

"There's your favorite," he said.

"Mmm," Sera said. "I used to skip those."

"Used to?"

"Before," she said. Her gaze flicked to the G-3 doors and back. "Now I fill them out. I write paragraphs the Companions didn't ask for." Her mouth curved. "Sometimes I use your name."

He turned to look at her fully for the first time since they'd sat down.

"Why?"

"Because it’s harder to optimize you away if your story is tangled up in all their 'support metrics'," she said. "Because Ruth was right about talking to the walls. And because if they’re going to model community risk, they should remember community isn’t just something that gets hurt. It’s something that holds."

He swallowed. The corridor noise blurred at the edges, voices and footsteps and door chimes fading to a dull wash.

"And if they decide I'm too much risk anyway?" he asked. "If the next review says I can't be in the gardens at all? Or near the pumps?"

Sera's jaw tightened, but her eyes stayed on his.

"Then we will still be here," she said. "On benches, in corridors, in whatever spaces they think are 'low impact'. Samuel in the hull. Alina with her paints. Me with my stupid surveys. We will keep saying your name to each other and to the Ship until it has to carry you as a person and not just as a datapoint."

It sounded too big and too small at once, like all the promises people tried to make against vacuum and time. And yet: Jonah felt something in his chest shift fractionally, like a stuck valve easing.

A child broke away from a passing family then and stumbled toward the bench, chasing a rolling cup lid that had escaped their table. The lid skittered to a stop at Jonah's boot. He bent automatically, picked it up, and held it out.

"Here," he said.

The child — a little boy with hair in his eyes and a smear of nutrient gel on his cheek — took it solemnly.

"Thank you," he said, already half-turned back toward his parents. Then, as if remembering something, he looked up again. "My mama says you helped fix the water."

Jonah blinked.

"Your mama is very kind," he said.

"She says the Ship is kinder when we are," the boy said, parroting words clearly not his own. He grinned, gap-toothed, and ran back to his family.

Sera let out a breath that wobbled at the end.

"That's Ruth's line," Jonah said softly.

"Ruth's got better distribution than any Companion," Sera said.

They sat there a little longer, letting the corridor’s ordinary clatter wash over them: someone arguing mildly about shift rotations, someone complaining about the new safety drills, the hiss of a cleaning drone docking into its recess. The Ship’s hum threaded through it all, a low, steady presence.

For the first time since he’d watched himself on a medbay screen, Jonah let the sound settle without parsing it for threat. It was just there, same as the bench, same as the scuffed strip of floor where workers lined up their boots before going into G-3.

"We can go," Sera said eventually. "Before you run out of spoons." There was a faint smile in her voice.

"I thought the saying was 'run out of hours'," he said.

"Depends which part of you we're counting," she said.

He stood slowly. His legs ached, but it was the ache of use, not shock. The corridor seemed less like a gauntlet now, more like what it had always been: a place people passed through on their way to other work.

As they turned toward the tram, Jonah glanced back once at the G-3 doors. The access strip held steady at green. Behind it, new protocols and old soil waited. Maybe he would walk that row with Kira next week. Maybe he would just sit on this bench again and listen.

Either way, the Ship went on humming, carrying them all forward together.

For the first time in a long time, that forward motion felt like something he might be allowed to belong to.
