# Chapter 20: Final Observation

The viewport niche was smaller than he remembered.

As a boy, Jonah had thought it went on forever—an opening in the Ship’s skin big enough to fall through if you leaned too far. Now, standing in the narrow alcove at the edge of the ring, he could see the seams clearly. The reinforced frame, the layered transparencies, the faint distortion where radiation filters shimmered the stars at the corners.

"Access confirmed," the Companion said softly behind him. "Observation window occupancy logged."

"Just me," Jonah said. "No one to impress."

The door sighed shut. For a moment, there was only the steady hum of the Ship and the thin, almost imperceptible high note of the viewport’s field coils.


Outside, there was nothing.

Not literally—there were always pinpricks, spectral smears, the slow drift of a sparse star field. But compared to the tightly lit corridors and dense rings, the void beyond the glass felt like an absence given shape. A weight made of distance.

As a child, that had terrified him.

He remembered Alina’s small warm shoulder pressed against his, their breath fogging the lower edge of the glass as they craned to see anything that might make the dark less empty. He remembered counting the tiny, almost invisible specks that moved when the Ship adjusted course, telling himself that if the pattern stayed the same, they were safe.

Now he didn’t count.

He stood with his hands loosely at his sides and let his gaze rest on the place where the Ship’s faint running lights met the unlit black.


The meds took some of the sharpness from his thoughts. Edges that once caught on every possible failure rounded off. There were still moments—waking nights, unexpected silences in the corridors—when the old fear surged and he could feel Lydia’s storm reaching for him through memory.

But tonight, the hum in the walls matched his breathing.

In. The low vibration of life support.

Out. The faint tick of micro-adjustments in the frame.

He laid his fingertips gently against the bulkhead beside the window. Not quite Ruth’s old gesture of laying a full palm and praying aloud, but close enough that the echo of it moved up his arm.

"We’re still here," he said under his breath. "You’re still holding."

The Companion did not immediately respond. It had learned, by now, that some of his words did not require logging.


He thought of the day in Medbay, watching himself on the screen. The jagged, frantic figure in the gardens, pipe bursting, nutrient spray like pale rain. The moment his hand had closed on the manual valve as if he alone could keep the line from failing.

He thought of Samuel’s hand over his own in the same room later, the steady weight of it, the words: you are not your indices.

He thought of Sera in G-3, dirt under her nails, listening to a Core-voiced announcement and talking back to it as if arguing theology.

He thought of the Memory Vault: Lydia’s face half-lit by an old Earth window, her laugh in a kitchen that no longer existed anywhere but stored light. The way the recordings had refused to flatten her into just the end.

All of it layered under his skin like additional plates welded over a seam.


"Subject Jonah Hale," the Companion said quietly at last, as if to itself. "Current status: stable. Autonomy level: partial. Risk indices: decreasing trend."

He almost smiled.

"You practicing your bedtime stories for me?" he asked.

"Answering internal queries," it said. "Verbalization optional." A pause. "Would you prefer silence?"

He considered.

There had been a time when silence at a window like this would have felt like abandonment. As if the Ship had stopped listening, stopped caring whether he was there at all.

"No," he said. "I don’t mind you watching."

He exhaled, fogging the glass just enough to make a faint oval that quickly vanished.

"You know," he said, "when I was little, I thought if I looked away, we’d drift off course. Like my eyes were part of the guidance system."

"Your gaze has never been integrated into navigation algorithms," the Companion said.

"I figured that out eventually," he said, the corner of his mouth lifting. "Still feels wrong to turn my back on it sometimes."

He did it anyway.

He turned from the window and leaned his shoulders against the bulkhead, letting the void be behind him instead of in front. The Ship at his back, the dark now something he could feel rather than something he had to monitor.


"Trajectory remains nominal," the Companion offered.

"I know," he said. "It’s your job to watch now. Mine too, some days. But not like before." He tapped his temple lightly. "Not alone up here. Not at the cost of everything else."

He had teaching shifts now. Garden rounds with Sera, not as a guard but as a guest and sometimes helper. Messages from Alina full of her own storms and small, stubborn joys. Samuel’s steady presence at the end of a long day, a mug of something hot slid into his hands without comment.

The Ship still needed watching. Systems still failed, pipes still burst, people still frayed under the strain of too much metal and not enough sky.

But it did not all hinge on whether Jonah Hale stayed awake at the viewport.


He let his head rest lightly against the wall.

Ruth’s old prayer rose in him, unbidden. Not as a spell this time, not as a bargain, just as a familiar cadence.

"Hold the hull," he murmured. "Hold the rings. Hold the hands that hold the Ship."

He hesitated, then added, almost shyly: "Hold the minds that think they have to hold it alone."

There was no answer in words.

But a small shiver ran through the frame as the Ship made some minute correction, and the hum in the walls seemed to deepen for a heartbeat, like someone drawing a steadying breath.

"Amen," he said softly.

Outside, the darkness remained what it had always been: vast, indifferent, full of things they might never see.

Inside, in this thin band of warmth and metal, he stood and let it exist without needing to map every risk it contained.

For the first time he could remember, Jonah did not feel like he was watching for the moment everything would fail.

He felt, instead, like one small part of something still moving forward through the dark, held by forces larger than his fear.

He stayed until his legs began to ache from standing. Then he pushed away from the wall, glanced once more at the window—not to check, just to see—and stepped back into the corridor’s ordinary light.

The door closed behind him with a soft sigh, the viewport niche returning to its quiet watch.

The Ship hummed. Jonah walked with it, away from the glass, into whatever came next.
