# Alina Hale – Jonah's Sister

## Overview
Alina Hale is Jonah’s younger sister, three years his junior. Once a gifted children’s learning materials illustrator, she turned away from her talent believing it could never be a "real" contribution aboard the ship. Now she lives with chronic anxiety and a painful sense of not measuring up—especially around work, family expectations, and the hope of motherhood.

This profile captures her core tensions and how she fits into Hale family dynamics. Details may evolve as her role clarifies.

## Core Traits
- Younger than Jonah by three years
- Quietly perceptive and visually oriented
- Anxious, self-critical, often stuck in rumination
- Deeply caring, especially toward children and vulnerable people
- Conflict-avoidant but with a buried streak of stubbornness

## Strengths
- Strong artistic eye; sees beauty and meaning in small details
- Patient and gentle in one-on-one relationships
- Capable of deep, loyal attachment
- Good listener; people feel safe confiding in her

## Flaws
- Doubts her own worth and competence
- Minimizes or dismisses her creative gifts as "not real work"
- Procrastinates and freezes when faced with big decisions
- Compares herself harshly to peers who seem more "together"

## Emotional Wound
She once poured herself into training as a children’s learning materials illustrator and briefly thrived, creating diagrams, picture-stories, and gentle visual worlds for shipboard kids. Over time she internalized the message that such work was soft, indulgent, or less serious than "real" contributions. Abandoning that path left a lingering sense that she betrayed her own talent and the children she imagined learning through her work. Her current anxiety clusters around not achieving adult milestones—especially meaningful work and motherhood, which are now painfully tangled together in her mind.

By the time we meet her in the story, she works as a **Claim Mediation Officer** for habitat incidents: reviewing damage reports, system logs, and neighbor disputes, then recommending how repairs and responsibility should be assigned. The job uses her eye for detail but starves the part of her that once drew for children and imagined the lives they would grow into.

## Relationship Notes
- **Jonah:** She admires his obvious brilliance but also resents how easily others seem to name his gifts. She worries he will outgrow her. At the same time, he is one of the few people who truly saw her illustrations as real work.
- **Samuel:** She feels pressure to be steady and useful like him, and guilty when she cannot be. His quiet pride in her early work for children is both a comfort and a source of shame now.
- **Lydia:** Complicated mix of fear, tenderness, and anger. She recognizes some of Lydia’s heaviness in herself and is terrified of passing that on to a child.
- **Ruth:** A source of gentle, nonjudgmental faith. Ruth’s belief that creativity can be a form of worship is one of the few narratives that ever made Alina feel her art had value.

## Arc Hooks (Draft)
- Once considered for or enrolled in a track creating children’s educational materials (visual design and illustration for ship schools), then shifted to a more "practical" Claim Mediation Officer assignment she quietly hates.
- Wrestles with whether to pursue parenthood while feeling fundamentally unready and unworthy.
- May become an emotional mirror for Jonah: where he fears his mind will break like Lydia’s, she fears a life half-lived, defined by safety and smallness.
- Potential late-story moment where she tentatively returns to image-making—not as career success, but as a way of seeing and loving the world around her.
