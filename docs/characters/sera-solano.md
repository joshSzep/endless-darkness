# Sera Solano

## Overview
Sera Solano becomes the love of Jonah’s life. Curious, grounded, steady under pressure. She sees Jonah clearly, without fear or false optimism. She takes the lead early but never tries to fix him.

On the ship, she works as a hydroponics steward, responsible for sections of the communal gardens and food-growing arrays. Her days are a mix of quiet, repetitive care and constant, low-level social contact with crew who drift through the green spaces to work, talk, or just breathe different air.

## Core Traits
- Curious and thoughtful
- Patient and observant
- Emotionally mature
- Loyal without being self-sacrificing
- Has strong boundaries

## Strengths
- Reads people well
- Holds steady during emotional storms
- Comfort with silence
- Practical mindset
- Brave in subtle ways
- Deeply attuned to living systems (plants, people, routines)
- Creates small, stabilizing rituals around shared work and rest

## Flaws
- Hesitates to ask for help
- Can compartmentalize too much
- Sometimes carries her own pain quietly
- Uses work in the gardens as an excuse to avoid her own needs
- Tends to stay in familiar spaces rather than seek promotion or attention

## Emotional Wound
Comes from a family that is stable but closed off. Learned young that understanding someone deeply is rare and precious.

Her parents did honest, necessary work in ship maintenance and logistics, but treated feelings like leaks to be patched quietly, not discussed. Sera grew up in clean, organized compartments where everything had a place except grief and doubt. Hydroponics became her chosen counterpoint to that: a space where mess, growth, and slow change were expected, even welcomed.

## Relationship Notes
- **Jonah:** She sees the real him from the start.
	- First notices him as one of the few people who comes to the gardens and actually looks at the plants instead of just cutting through. His unease stands out against the calm routines she’s used to.
	- Their early conversations are often side-by-side while her hands are in nutrient solution or soil substitutes, letting silence do half the work.
- **Samuel:** He approves of her immediately.
	- Recognizes the "garden worker" steadiness he associates with old-Earth imagery of tending and keeping.
	- Trusts that anyone who spends their life nurturing fragile systems will be patient with Jonah’s inner weather.
- **Lydia:** Understands her sadness but never gets close.
	- Lydia finds the gardens beautiful but slightly unbearable, a reminder of what she’s lost and can’t name. Sera senses this and doesn’t push.
	- They share a few brief, quiet moments among the vines that Jonah never hears about, where Sera offers presence more than words.

## Arc Notes
- Becomes Jonah’s anchor.
- Plays a critical role during his crisis.
- Helps him choose connection over isolation.
- The gardens become one of the few places on the ship that genuinely feels like "home" to Jonah, largely because of her.
- As Jonah’s world widens into more dangerous ship systems, Sera’s arc is partly about choosing when to leave the safety of hydroponics to meet him in those spaces, and when to insist that he come back to the light and air with her.
