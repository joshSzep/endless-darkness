For countless generations, humanity has drifted through silent space inside a rotating metal world that remembers everything its people try to forget. Jonah Hale has always felt the ship watching him, tracking him, echoing the patterns of the mother he fears he is becoming. When his mind begins to slip, the ship's AI intervenes, civilians panic, and Jonah becomes the center of a cultural reckoning that has been building for decades. As hallucinations blur into warnings and old traumas surface in both man and machine, Jonah discovers that the darkness outside is nothing compared to the darkness a society refuses to face. To survive, both he and the ship must learn the same thing: you cannot outrun what you carry.
