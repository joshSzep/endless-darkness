# **Endless Darkness — Beat Sheet**

# **Act I — Formation**

## Scene-to-Beat Map

- `the-day-jonah-walked-away.md`  
	**Act I – 3. Lydia’s Shadow (core)**  
	Young Jonah freezes in the doorway instead of helping Lydia; establishes his core wound and "if I get close, I break things" pattern.

- `stability-log-age-10.md`  
	**Act I – 7. Ship Culture & Stigma (core)**  
	Behavioral Stability mediation scene; Jonah experiences his inner life turned into data and learns his family can be logged as "stability" risks.

- `jonah-early-ai-aptitude-test.md`  
	**Act I – 5. AI Aptitude Test (core)**  
	Quiet, clinical first encounter with deeper AI evaluation; he feels the machine looking *through* him and senses higher stakes than adults admit.

- `samuel-in-the-hull-corridors.md`  
	**Act I – 4. Samuel’s Steadiness / 2. Life on the Ship (core)**  
	Adolescent Jonah watches Samuel work the hull; father as anchor, void as presence, and the ship’s architecture/maintenance culture established.

- `ruth-teaches-jonah-to-pray-for-the-ship.md`  
	**Act I – 2. Life on the Ship / 6. Generational Trauma Hints (core)**  
	Outline: Ruth folds hull, AI, and God into one prayer, tying faith to maintenance and giving Jonah a coping ritual that will echo in later corridor panic.

- `shipboard-sermon-tau-ceti-mythos.md`  
	**Act I – 2. Life on the Ship / 6. Generational Trauma Hints (echo)**  
	Working‑sector worship hall; Tau Ceti as myth and mission, Jonah absorbing mission-as-calling language alongside family faith.

- `sermon-in-the-rotational-drift.md`  
	**Act II – 12. Maternal History Reopened (echo into faith context)**  
	Later sermon in a different hall; used as a structural echo to show Jonah older, comparing mythic Tau Ceti rhetoric with his engineer brain.

- `alina-and-jonah-night-in-the-viewport-niche.md`  
	**Act I – 1. Opening Image / 2. Life on the Ship (core)**  
	Small viewport niche; siblings watch the literal nothing outside. Establishes ship-scale confinement, Jonah’s hyper‑vigilance, and Alina as mirror.

- `stability-log-age-10.md` + `the-day-jonah-walked-away.md` (pairing note)  
	These function together as **Act I spine**: family depression → institutional logging → Jonah’s belief that his emotions are dangerous variables.

- `jonah-ai-engineer-training-eval.md`  
	**Act II – 11. Early Bonding (professional) / 15. AI Monitoring Begins (core)**  
	Early–mid training evaluation; shows Jonah’s competence and the way "routine" psychological monitoring feeds his terror of being judged unfit.

- `integrated-too-well.md`  
	**Late Act II / early Act III – 16. Hypomanic Surge / 22. AI Concern Escalates (core)**

- `first-shared-shift-in-the-gardens.md`  
	**Act II – 9. The Meet / 11. Early Bonding (core)**  
	First proper Jonah–Sera interaction on shift; hydroponics as soft, humid counterpoint to metal corridors and the AI’s gaze.

- `shift-change-bench-jonah-sera.md`  
	**Act II – 11. Early Bonding (quiet core, to be drafted)**  
	Shift-change bench outside hydroponics: Jonah and Sera share lukewarm tea, compare how they each hear Ship noise, and manage to make each other laugh once, grounding their connection in ordinary overlap rather than only crisis.

- `alina-at-the-rail.md`  
	**Act II – 13. Jonah’s Emotional Fracture Line (echo)**  
	Maglev ride; Alina articulates scale and mood, Jonah in reluctant caretaker role, reinforcing inheritance and ship vastness.

- `power-flicker-in-the-maintenance-corridor.md`  
	**Act II – 16. Hypomanic Surge / 18. Ghost‑Logic Patterns (core)**  
	Early corridor panic during a minor glitch; tiny external fluctuation opens a crack between ship reality and Jonah’s inner storm, blurring the line between hull noise and inherited fear.

- `alina-in-diagnostic-theatre.md`  
	**Act II – 15. AI Monitoring Begins (family echo, outline)**  
	Creative aptitude session that quietly mirrors Jonah’s earlier tests; Alina glimpses their family storms in the AI’s risk templates.

- `alina-post-diagnostic-conversation.md`  
	**Act II – 13. Jonah’s Emotional Fracture Line / 15. AI Monitoring Begins (family echo, to be drafted)**  
	After the diagnostic, Alina corners Jonah in a quiet stairwell or niche and mentions the "HALE/MARLOW" comparator; they trade dark jokes and small comforts, and Jonah’s protective terror spikes as he sees his storms reflected in her.

# **Act III — Unraveling**

## Scene-to-Beat Map

- `ai-quiet-intervention-hydroponics.md`  
	**Act III – 22. AI Concern Escalates (core)**

	**Act III – 22. AI Concern Escalates / 19. Civilian Rumblings (system‑side core, outline)**

- `break-room-rumors-garden-intervention.md`  
	**Act III – 19. Civilian Rumblings (echo, to be drafted)**  
	Hydroponics break room scene after the AI’s "behavioral health optimization" routing: workers trade distorted versions of Jonah’s pre-critical status and argue about how much they trust the Companions, turning Jonah into a whispered example of the Ship "babysitting" engineers.

- `jonah-scheduled-for-deactivation-review.md`  
	**Act IV – 26. Civilian Panic / 30. The AI Confesses Failure (procedural core, outline)**  
	Deactivation risk review; human + Companion committee reduces his life to variables, with Samuel and Sera’s statements as stabilizing data points.

- `samuel-medbay-support-scene.md`  
	**Act IV – 28. Samuel’s Love (core)**

- `sera-alone-with-the-core-announcement.md`  
	**Act V – 36. Human + AI Reconciliation (macro‑scale echo, core)**

	**Act V – 32. Stabilization / 37. Community Re‑entry (core)**  
	Post‑medbay ordinary day: pillbox ritual, Companion health surveys, low‑stakes teaching work, brief hydroponics visit with Sera, and Samuel/Alina contact; shows lived texture of treatment, boundaries, and cautious reintegration.

- `final-observation-port-scene.md`  
	**Act V – 38. Final Quiet Moment (core)**  
	Jonah returns to the viewport niche from childhood, prays Ruth’s hull prayer in a softer key, and lets the Ship and its darkness exist without needing to watch for failure, feeling held as one small part of its forward motion.
