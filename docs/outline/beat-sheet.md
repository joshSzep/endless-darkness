# **Endless Darkness — Beat Sheet**

# **Act I — Formation**

## Scene-to-Beat Map

- `the-day-jonah-walked-away.md`  
	**Act I – 3. Lydia’s Shadow (core)**  
	Young Jonah freezes in the doorway instead of helping Lydia; establishes his core wound and "if I get close, I break things" pattern.

- `stability-log-age-10.md`  
	**Act I – 7. Ship Culture & Stigma (core)**  
	Behavioral Stability mediation scene; Jonah experiences his inner life turned into data and learns his family can be logged as "stability" risks.

- `jonah-early-ai-aptitude-test.md`  
	**Act I – 5. AI Aptitude Test (core)**  
	Quiet, clinical first encounter with deeper AI evaluation; he feels the machine looking *through* him and senses higher stakes than adults admit.

- `samuel-in-the-hull-corridors.md`  
	**Act I – 4. Samuel’s Steadiness / 2. Life on the Ship (core)**  
	Adolescent Jonah watches Samuel work the hull; father as anchor, void as presence, and the ship’s architecture/maintenance culture established.

- `ruth-teaches-jonah-to-pray-for-the-ship.md`  
	**Act I – 2. Life on the Ship / 6. Generational Trauma Hints (core)**  
	Outline: Ruth folds hull, AI, and God into one prayer, tying faith to maintenance and giving Jonah a coping ritual that will echo in later corridor panic.

- `shipboard-sermon-tau-ceti-mythos.md`  
	**Act I – 2. Life on the Ship / 6. Generational Trauma Hints (echo)**  
	Working‑sector worship hall; Tau Ceti as myth and mission, Jonah absorbing mission-as-calling language alongside family faith.

- `sermon-in-the-rotational-drift.md`  
	**Act II – 12. Maternal History Reopened (echo into faith context)**  
	Later sermon in a different hall; used as a structural echo to show Jonah older, comparing mythic Tau Ceti rhetoric with his engineer brain.

- `alina-and-jonah-night-in-the-viewport-niche.md`  
	**Act I – 1. Opening Image / 2. Life on the Ship (core)**  
	Small viewport niche; siblings watch the literal nothing outside. Establishes ship-scale confinement, Jonah’s hyper‑vigilance, and Alina as mirror.

- `stability-log-age-10.md` + `the-day-jonah-walked-away.md` (pairing note)  
	These function together as **Act I spine**: family depression → institutional logging → Jonah’s belief that his emotions are dangerous variables.

	Pre‑evaluation dinner; faith, expectations, and mental-health anxiety in one room the night before a major AI track assessment.

- `jonah-ai-engineer-training-eval.md`  
	**Act II – 11. Early Bonding (professional) / 15. AI Monitoring Begins (core)**  
	Early–mid training evaluation; shows Jonah’s competence and the way "routine" psychological monitoring feeds his terror of being judged unfit.

- `integrated-too-well.md` or `jonah-integrated-eval-too-well.md`  
	**Late Act II / early Act III – 16. Hypomanic Surge / 22. AI Concern Escalates (core – choose one canonical draft)**  
	Integrated evaluation where the network demonstrates how thoroughly it knows him, classifying him as both asset and risk.

- `first-shared-shift-in-the-gardens.md`  
	**Act II – 9. The Meet / 11. Early Bonding (core)**  
	First proper Jonah–Sera interaction on shift; hydroponics as soft, humid counterpoint to metal corridors and the AI’s gaze.

- `alina-at-the-rail.md`  
	**Act II – 13. Jonah’s Emotional Fracture Line (echo)**  
	Maglev ride; Alina articulates scale and mood, Jonah in reluctant caretaker role, reinforcing inheritance and ship vastness.

- `power-flicker-in-the-maintenance-corridor.md` or `jonah-power-flicker-corridor.md`  
	**Act II – 16. Hypomanic Surge / 18. Ghost‑Logic Patterns (core – choose one canonical draft)**  
	Early corridor panic during a minor glitch; tiny external flicker opens crack between ship reality and Jonah’s inner storm.

- `alina-in-diagnostic-theatre.md`  
	**Act II – 15. AI Monitoring Begins (family echo, outline)**  
	Creative aptitude session that quietly mirrors Jonah’s earlier tests; Alina glimpses their family storms in the AI’s risk templates.

# **Act III — Unraveling**

## Scene-to-Beat Map

- `ai-quiet-intervention-hydroponics.md`  
	**Act III – 22. AI Concern Escalates (core)**  
	Sera POV; Companion routing Jonah to her sector as "behavioral health optimization" and labeling him pre‑critical while using gardens as a stabilizing environment.

- `jonah-sera-first-real-argument.md`  
	**Act III – 17. Sera’s Concern / 21. Jonah’s Inner Narrative Breaks (core)**  
	Closed‑gardens argument; quiet, low‑volume fight where Jonah recognizes Lydia‑patterns in himself and Sera holds her boundaries.

- `companion-simulates-lydia-for-risk-modeling.md`  
	**Act III – 22. AI Concern Escalates / 19. Civilian Rumblings (system‑side core, outline)**  
	AI‑log style scene: Lydia reconstructed as dataset, Jonah/Alina overlaid, and redacted from human view; explains why the net tightens now.

- `power-flicker-in-the-maintenance-corridor.md` / `jonah-power-flicker-corridor.md` (placement note)  
	If pushed later, can serve as **Act III – 23. The Slip (echo)** – an escalation from unease to near blackout of control in the same corridor geography.

	Sera hears a rare, Core‑voiced announcement about updated safeguards and answers it with a small act of care in the gardens.

- `memory-vault-pilgrimage.md`  
	**Act V – 35. Rewriting the Narrative (core)**  
	Jonah, Sera, and Samuel access Lydia’s archived life; forgiveness without erasing harm, and reframing inheritance.

- `ordinary-managed-day-on-meds.md`  
	**Act V – 32. Stabilization / 37. Community Re‑entry (core)**  
	Post‑medbay ordinary day: pillbox ritual, Companion health surveys, low‑stakes teaching work, brief hydroponics visit with Sera, and Samuel/Alina contact; shows lived texture of treatment, boundaries, and cautious reintegration.
