# **Act I — Formation**

## Scene-to-Beat Map

- `the-day-jonah-walked-away.md`  
	**Act I – 3. Lydia’s Shadow (core)**  
	Young Jonah freezes in the doorway instead of helping Lydia; establishes his core wound and "if I get close, I break things" pattern.

- `stability-log-age-10.md`  
	**Act I – 7. Ship Culture & Stigma (core)**  
	Behavioral Stability mediation scene; Jonah experiences his inner life turned into data and learns his family can be logged as "stability" risks.

- `jonah-early-ai-aptitude-test.md`  
	**Act I – 5. AI Aptitude Test (core)**  
	Quiet, clinical first encounter with deeper AI evaluation; he feels the machine looking *through* him and senses higher stakes than adults admit.

- `samuel-in-the-hull-corridors.md`  
	**Act I – 4. Samuel’s Steadiness / 2. Life on the Ship (core)**  
	Adolescent Jonah watches Samuel work the hull; father as anchor, void as presence, and the ship’s architecture/maintenance culture established.

- `ordinary-family-shift-morning.md`  
	**Act I – 2. Life on the Ship (echo)**  
	Working-sector morning in the Hale/Marlow quarters and corridor: Samuel prepping for hull work, Lydia functioning but fragile, Ruth’s faith echo in a small departure ritual, and Jonah/Alina navigating cramped routines, grounding later crises in a lived-in sense of "normal" ship life.

- `ruth-teaches-jonah-to-pray-for-the-ship.md`  
	**Act I – 2. Life on the Ship / 6. Generational Trauma Hints (core)**  
	Ruth folds hull, AI, and God into one prayer, tying faith to maintenance and giving Jonah a coping ritual that will echo in later corridor panic.

- `shipboard-sermon-tau-ceti-mythos.md`  
	**Act I – 2. Life on the Ship / 6. Generational Trauma Hints (echo)**  
	Working‑sector worship hall; Tau Ceti as myth and mission, Jonah absorbing mission-as-calling language alongside family faith.

- `sermon-in-the-rotational-drift.md`  
	**Act II – 12. Maternal History Reopened (echo into faith context)**  
	Later sermon in a different hall; used as a structural echo to show Jonah older, comparing mythic Tau Ceti rhetoric with his engineer brain.

- `alina-and-jonah-night-in-the-viewport-niche.md`  
	**Act I – 1. Opening Image / 2. Life on the Ship (core)**  
	Small viewport niche; siblings watch the literal nothing outside. Establishes ship-scale confinement, Jonah’s hyper‑vigilance, and Alina as mirror.

- `stability-log-age-10.md` + `the-day-jonah-walked-away.md` (pairing note)  
	These function together as **Act I spine**: family depression → institutional logging → Jonah’s belief that his emotions are dangerous variables.

- `shift-change-bench-jonah-sera.md`

- `alina-at-the-rail.md`  
	**Act II – 13. Jonah’s Emotional Fracture Line (echo)**

	**Act II – 16. Hypomanic Surge / 18. Ghost‑Logic Patterns (core)**

- `break-room-rumors-garden-intervention.md`  
	**Act III – 19. Civilian Rumblings (echo)**  
	Hydroponics break room scene after the AI’s "behavioral health optimization" routing: Sera listens as co-workers gossip about Jonah’s pre-critical status and worry about the Ship "babysitting" them, revealing both unease with Companion power and the importance of peer support.

- `late-night-node-precritical-pings.md`  
	**Act III – 22. AI Concern Escalates (Jonah-side core)**  
	Late node shift where Companions bombard Jonah with "micro" wellness checks; Jonah stumbles onto his own pre-critical status in the console, learning exactly how the Ship has labeled him and what interventions that authorizes.

- `companion-debates-thresholds-on-jonah.md`  
	**Act III – 22. AI Concern Escalates (system echo)**  
	Regional Companion log revisiting Jonah’s flicker, hydroponics routing, and current indices in light of the Lydia model; it explicitly weighs enforced rest or containment against preserving Jonah’s autonomy and community supports, and chooses to maintain soft interventions while lowering thresholds for emergency response.

## Scene-to-Beat Map

- `garden-incident-live.md`  
	**Act IV – 24. The Episode (core)**  
	On‑page version of the Garden Incident in G-3: minor oscillation, Jonah's unauthorized override, cascading failure, and emergency flood response that injures bystanders and anchors his worst fear in shared memory.

	**Act IV – 27. Human Cost in the Hallway (echo)**

- `core-evaluates-jonah-post-incident.md`  
	**Act IV – 30. The AI Confesses Failure (system-side echo)**  
	Core/Companion log scene paralleling the review: the AI aggregates footage, Lydia-model projections, public impact metrics, and Samuel/Sera testimony, acknowledges its own threshold miscalculations in Jonah's case, updates its loss function to include relational harm, and begins to treat him as more than a failed asset.

- `civilians-react-to-garden-lockdown.md`  
	**Act IV – 25. Civilian Panic (echo)**  
	Hydroponics-adjacent concourse scene from Sofi's POV where workers and families encounter sealed G-3 doors, Companion "no mission threat" reassurances, rumors about a worker "losing it," and a small act of neighborly care that turns Jonah's unseen episode into a whispered, complicated shipboard story.

- `final-observation-port-scene.md`  
	**Act V – 38. Final Quiet Moment (core)**
