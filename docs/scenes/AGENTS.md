---

- [`alina-in-diagnostic-theatre.md`](./alina-in-diagnostic-theatre.md) – Alina undergoes a "creative aptitude" assessment that quietly screens her for Hale/Marlow-style instability, using Jonah’s profile as a comparative template.
- [`ai-quiet-intervention-hydroponics.md`](./ai-quiet-intervention-hydroponics.md) – Sera in hydroponics learns the AI is quietly rerouting Jonah and installing supports, revealing him as a "pre‑critical" risk and her as a stabilizing resource.
- [`alina-at-the-rail.md`](./alina-at-the-rail.md) – Maglev viewport scene where Jonah and Alina joke, then confront inherited fear of "catching" their mother’s illness.
- [`companion-simulates-lydia-for-risk-modeling.md`](./companion-simulates-lydia-for-risk-modeling.md) – System-perspective vignette where a Companion reconstructs Lydia from records to refine risk models for Jonah and Alina, then hides the simulation as "non-therapeutic."
- [`first-shared-shift-in-the-gardens.md`](./first-shared-shift-in-the-gardens.md) – Jonah’s first real work shift with Sera in hydroponics; side‑by‑side repair and gentle questions establish their dynamic and the gardens as refuge.
- [`integrated-too-well.md`](./integrated-too-well.md) – High-level AI integration evaluation where Jonah’s brilliance and lifelong behavioral data lead the system to flag him as both uniquely valuable and high‑risk.
- [`jonah-ai-engineer-training-eval.md`](./jonah-ai-engineer-training-eval.md) – Earlier AI engineer training evaluation that shows Jonah’s aptitude, anxiety about psych review, and the ship’s vetting process.
- [`jonah-early-ai-aptitude-test.md`](./jonah-early-ai-aptitude-test.md) – Childhood aptitude assessment where Jonah is first tagged as a strong AI candidate and quietly added to long‑term behavioral tracking.
- [`jonah-integrated-eval-too-well.md`](./jonah-integrated-eval-too-well.md) – Alternate/earlier take on the integrated eval concept; overlapping material with `integrated-too-well.md` from a slightly different structural angle.
- [`jonah-scheduled-for-deactivation-review.md`](./jonah-scheduled-for-deactivation-review.md) – Post-crisis committee review where Jonah’s continued access to high-autonomy roles is debated in abstract risk language, with Samuel and Sera’s statements weighed as variables.
- [`jonah-power-flicker-corridor.md`](./jonah-power-flicker-corridor.md) – Original corridor power‑flicker vignette showing Jonah’s disproportionate fear response to a minor systems glitch.
- [`medbay-watching-himself.md`](./medbay-watching-himself.md) – Post‑Garden Incident medbay scene where Jonah watches curated footage of his own crisis while the AI narrates and Samuel/Sera stay present, prompting him to accept ongoing help.
- [`memory-vault-pilgrimage.md`](./memory-vault-pilgrimage.md) – Late‑story visit to a Memory Vault where Jonah, Sera, and Samuel selectively view Lydia’s records; Jonah chooses what to carry and what to leave closed, reframing trauma as history.
- [`power-flicker-in-the-maintenance-corridor.md`](./power-flicker-in-the-maintenance-corridor.md) – Refined power‑flicker scene where ship-noise briefly resolves into his mother saying his name, blurring outer hull strain and inner storm.
- [`ruth-teaches-jonah-to-pray-for-the-ship.md`](./ruth-teaches-jonah-to-pray-for-the-ship.md) – Childhood night scene where Ruth teaches Jonah an adapted prayer for hull, AI, and family to "hold," giving him a ritual he later mutters in corridors.
- [`samuel-in-the-hull-corridors.md`](./samuel-in-the-hull-corridors.md) – Jonah accompanies Samuel through hull corridors; lessons on listening to the ship, trust, and not treating himself as a single point of failure.
- [`sermon-in-the-rotational-drift.md`](./sermon-in-the-rotational-drift.md) – Drifting worship‑hall sermon tying Tau Ceti, mission myth, and "Ones Who Broke" together while Jonah and Sera share space without yet connecting.
- [`sera-alone-with-the-core-announcement.md`](./sera-alone-with-the-core-announcement.md) – Sera hears a rare, Core-toned ship-wide announcement about "stability safeguards" and measures Jonah’s humanity against impersonal optimization.
- [`shipboard-sermon-tau-ceti-mythos.md`](./shipboard-sermon-tau-ceti-mythos.md) – Broader liturgical/sermon scene exploring how Tau Ceti and the mission are preached and mythologized aboard ship.
- [`stability-log-age-10.md`](./stability-log-age-10.md) – Age‑10 mediation after a viewport incident where Jonah first encounters Behavioral Stability Logs and realizes the ship keeps a "stability profile" on him.
- [`the-day-jonah-walked-away.md`](./the-day-jonah-walked-away.md) – Seven‑year‑old Jonah finds Lydia frozen at the kitchen table, freezes himself, and walks away, creating the core guilt that shapes his later choices.
