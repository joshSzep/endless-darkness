# Scene: Alina and Jonah – Night in the Viewport Niche

## Context
- POV: close third, Jonah
- Tense: past
- Placement: Act I — late Formation, pre-teen Jonah (around 12) and Alina (9). After "The Day Jonah Walked Away" and some stability logs, but before formal AI aptitude tracking becomes part of Jonah’s conscious story.
- Tone: hushed, slightly eerie, tender; a small, ordinary sibling moment that quietly braids in fear of inheritance and the emptiness outside.

The viewport niche was too small to be official.

It sat at the end of a service corridor off one of the quieter residential bands, a leftover seam where two structural modules hadn’t lined up cleanly. Someone, decades ago, had decided to cap the gap with reinforced glass instead of more paneling. The result was a window barely wider than Jonah’s shoulders, set low enough that you had to sit on the floor to use it.

Most people didn’t. The corridor wasn’t on any scenic route. You only came down here if you had a reason—or a habit.

Tonight, Jonah had both.

He found Alina already there, curled up with her knees hugged to her chest, forehead almost touching the glass. The emergency strip along the floor threw a narrow line of light across her socks and the lower half of the viewport. Everything else was shadow.

"You’re supposed to be in bed," he said.

She jumped a little, then relaxed when she saw it was him.

"So are you," she said.

"I’m older," he said automatically.

"By three years," she said. "That’s not that much."

He sat down beside her anyway, back against the opposite wall, feet braced on the deck. The metal was cold through his thin pants. The air had that faint tang of nearby ventilation, less scrubbed than in the main corridors.

Beyond the glass, there was nothing.

No stars from here. The viewport faced a part of the hull where the exterior sensors rarely bothered to project sky-feeds. What Jonah could see was the inner layer of transparent armor, a thin sliver of actual hull in cross-section, and then a dark that wasn’t quite black—more like an absence that made his eyes want to slide off it.

He watched it anyway. It made the quiet inside his chest feel less alone.

"You see anything?" Alina asked.

"There’s nothing to see," he said.

"I know," she said. "But do you see anything."

He glanced at her. Her voice had that too-careful edge that meant she was thinking about their mother.

"No," he said. "Just…nothing."

She nodded, as if that were data she’d been waiting to log.

"You?" he asked.

She hesitated.

"Sometimes," she said. "When I’m tired. The dark looks…closer."

He followed her gaze. The glass sat flush in its frame, the gasket seal unbroken. He knew, intellectually, how much composite and layered shielding separated them from vacuum. He could recite the numbers from school.

"It’s not," he said.

"I know," she said again. "Just looks that way. Like it’s leaning in."

He didn’t have an answer for that. He leaned his head back against the bulkhead and closed his eyes for a second, listening to the hum of the ship: the distant rush of air through ducts, the faint vibration under the soles of his feet.

"Dad says the dark doesn’t move," he said.

"Dad says a lot of things," Alina said.

There was no disrespect in it. Just tired affection.

"He’s right, though," Jonah said. "The ship moves. We move. The dark just…is."

"That’s worse," she said softly.

He opened his eyes.

"How?" he asked.

"If it moved," she said, "you could pretend it was going somewhere. Or that it would leave you alone if you stayed still. If it just sits there, then it’s always waiting."

He hadn’t thought about it like that.

"You been drawing this again?" he asked.

Her cheeks colored in the half-light.

"Maybe," she said.

He pictured her sketchbook—the one she kept tucked under her mattress, pages full of simplified ships and smiling kids and stars that looked nothing like the real feeds. Lately there had been more empty spaces in those drawings. Blank ovals where planets should be. Little shadowed corners.

"If you’re drawing it," he said, "you’re making it yours. That’s different."

"Tell that to Mom," she said.

The word hung there, heavier than the dark.

They both knew what she meant. How their mother had once painted little suns on the inside of cupboard doors and then, later, couldn’t bring herself to open them.

"She’s having a bad week," Jonah said carefully.

"She’s always having a bad week," Alina said, then winced at herself. "Sorry. I just…"

She trailed off, tucking a stray hair behind her ear.

"Do you ever worry it’s catching?" she asked.

The question landed like a hand over his mouth.

He thought of the kitchen table. Of his own feet retreating down the hall. Of the way he’d frozen, useless, while Samuel moved.

"No," he lied.

Alina made a small sound that might have been a laugh.

"I do," she said. "All the time."

He turned to look at her fully.

"You’re not her," he said.

"Neither are you," she shot back.

He opened his mouth, then closed it again.

"Sometimes," she went on, "when I’m in class and the teacher’s talking and I can’t make my brain stay with them, I…pretend I’m just tired. Or hungry. Or the vents are too loud. I make lists. Anything but what it feels like."

"Like what?" he asked, even though he knew.

She swallowed.

"Like my mind is…sliding off the world," she said. "Like I’m watching myself from the hallway and I’m scared if I move, I’ll make a noise and everyone will see I’m wrong."

He exhaled slowly.

"That’s just anxiety," he said.

She gave him a look.

"You say that like it’s a different thing," she said.

"It is," he said. "Anxiety is…worry about things that haven’t happened yet."

"And what Mom has?" she asked.

He flinched.

"I don’t know what Mom has," he said. "I just know—I just know Dad says the doctors are helping and the Ship is watching and we’re not supposed to—"

"Talk about it," she finished with him.

They sat in silence for a long moment.

The ship hummed. The dark stayed where it was.

"What if," Alina said at last, voice very small, "what if there’s a line and we can’t see it. And one day we wake up and we’ve…stepped over."

Jonah stared straight ahead.

"Then we step back," he said.

"Is it that easy?" she asked.

"No," he admitted. "But…Dad does. A little. With her."

He remembered Samuel’s hands on Lydia’s shoulders, his steady voice. The way he never flinched, even when Lydia’s eyes went far away.

"He holds on," Jonah said. "So she doesn’t drift too far."

"Who holds on to us?" Alina asked.

The question hit him in the sternum.

"I do," he said, before he could think about whether it was true.

She turned her head, searching his face.

"You can’t," she said gently. "You’re already holding on to her. And Dad. And the Ship."

He wanted to protest. He wanted to say he was strong enough, that he could be all the anchor points they needed if he just tried harder.

The words stuck.

"We hold on to each other," he said instead, quieter. "Right?"

Alina considered that.

"Like a tether," she said.

"Yeah," he said. "Like a tether."

She reached down and hooked her pinky finger through his.

"Then don’t let go," she said.

"I won’t," he said.

It felt, in that moment, like a promise he could keep.

They sat like that, side by side, fingers linked, watching the non-sky beyond the glass.

After a while, the dark stopped looking like something that might lean in. It looked like what it was: a vast, indifferent nothing. The thing that made the thin layer of hull between them and it feel precious.

Jonah listened to the hum under his feet, to Alina’s steady breathing, to the distant murmur of a Companion somewhere further up the corridor talking somebody else through a routine.

He imagined a stability log recording this: two kids out of bed, heart rates elevated but not dangerous, thoughts circling topics they didn’t have names for.

He hoped, irrationally, that if the Ship was watching, it would see the pinky tether too.

"We should go back," he said eventually.

"In a minute," Alina said.

He let her have the minute.

Later, when they got up, their legs prickling with pins and needles, the dark stayed where it was. The Ship held. The promise he’d made sat under his ribs like a new, bright weight.

He did not know yet how hard it would be to keep.
