The maglev car hummed like a held breath.

Jonah stood with his shoulder against the cool curve of the bulkhead, one hand wrapped around the waist-high rail that ran the length of the car. The world beyond the narrow viewing slit slid past in a continuous ribbon: residential bands giving way to forest strips, patchwork farms, then the bluish haze where detail surrendered to distance and curvature.

Overhead, the opposite side of the cylinder arched like a dimmer echo—an upside-down coastline of lights and rivers, anchored by nothing but spin and faith in engineering.

"You'd think it would get boring," Alina said, leaning in closer to the glass. "Same view, every time."

"It is the same view every time," Jonah said.

She made a small noise in her throat, halfway between agreement and protest. "Yeah, but it feels different. Like sometimes it's more…" She searched for the word, hand describing an imprecise circle in the air. "More big."

Jonah watched her reflection rather than the landscape. At eighteen, she was still gangly in a way that made him think of half-finished scaffolding—elbows and knees slightly out of proportion, movements a fraction of a beat behind her thoughts. Her dark hair was pulled back into a quick knot at the base of her skull, a few strands floating with each subtle shift of the car.

"That's just your mood," he said. "Ship isn't changing size."

"You don't know that," she replied, automatic. "Maybe it's shrinking. Maybe every time we make this trip, it's a millimeter shorter."

"That would be a problem," Jonah said. "You'd notice it in gravity gradients."

"You would notice," she corrected. "The rest of us would just think we were tired."

The car eased through a gentle curve. The view outside swung from forest to a long chain of reservoirs, their surfaces a fractured mosaic of light. Tiny glints marked transit pods skimming low over the water, too far to hear, barely more than annotations on the ship's inner skin.

A group of workers in orange vests talked quietly at the far end of the car. Closer by, a mother rocked a toddler who was determined to kick the rail in steady rhythm. Each thud traveled faintly through Jonah's hand.

"I always forget there are whole towns I’ve never seen," Alina said. "Like that one." She pointed with her chin toward a cluster of buildings that clung to the slope just before the world curved out of sight—a dense knot of structures, their lights arranged in a pattern Jonah didn't recognize.

"Sector K-thirty-two," he said.

"You've been?"

"Not inside. Just…" He lifted his other hand to indicate the vague expanse. "Diagnostics."

"Of course." She rolled her eyes. "You've 'seen' it the way the Ship sees it. Numbers and error bars."

He shrugged. "Best angle, if you don't want to get lost."

"You're already lost," Alina said, but there was no bite to it. She shifted her weight and bumped his shoulder lightly with hers. "You spend more time with processing nodes than with people."

"Processing nodes don't ask rude questions on trains."

"Rude?" Her eyebrows lifted. "That was a compliment. Kind of."

He smiled despite himself. The car's lights flickered once as they passed a junction and then steadied. Reflexively, he scanned the status display over the door: no fault indicators, no route changes, everything green.

Alina followed his gaze, then snorted. "You really can't not do that, can you?"

"What?"

"Check. Measure. Make sure the Ship isn't about to fall apart under your feet." She tilted her head. "You were like that when we were kids. Remember the old walkway over the drainage canal? You wouldn't let me cross until you'd bounced on every panel."

"One of them was cracked," he said. "You almost went through it."

"Almost," she echoed. "Because you were there."

He had no answer for that, so he didn't try to find one.

The car slowed slightly as it approached the next transit hub, inertia pressing them subtly toward the front. Outside, the view shifted to a more urban band: stacked habitats, transit towers, a distant glimpse of a market plaza where dots of color moved between stalls.

"Do you ever think about transferring?" Alina asked.

"To what?" Jonah kept his tone light. "Entertainment?"

"Very funny." She wrapped both hands around the rail, fingers pale where the metal pressed. "Just…another sector. Different work. Different people."

He thought of his console station, the familiar layout of graphs and alerts. The way the local Companion tailored its displays to his preferences without comment. The sense of control he could sometimes convince himself he had there.

"No," he said. "Do you?"

She shrugged, the movement small. "Sometimes I think about going closer to the hull."

He turned to look at her more fully. "You hate the hull."

"I hate that Dad comes back from it limping sometimes," she said. "I don't hate the idea of…" She gestured toward the unseen outer skin. "Knowing what's really between us and outside."

Jonah's chest tightened. "You can 'know' without—"

"Don't start," she cut in, half laughing. "You're going to start listing layers and materials and failure tolerances. I can hear you charging up."

He let out a breath that might have been a laugh. "Fine."

They watched in silence for a while. The car's hum changed pitch as it entered a tunnel, the outside view replaced by a distorted reflection of the interior—faces smudged together on a faintly curved surface.

In the window's ghost-glass, Alina's reflection looked older. Or maybe that was just the lighting.

"Hey," she said, too casually. "Can I ask you something without you doing the thing where you go quiet and then make a joke?"

"That's very specific slander," he said. "But sure."

She didn't smile this time. "Do you ever worry you'll…catch it?"

He didn't ask what "it" was. The word landed in the empty space between their reflections and the humming dark of the tunnel.

"No," he said reflexively. Too fast.

Alina's eyes, in the glass, narrowed. "Liar."

Jonah made himself breathe in, out. Counted heartbeats. On the far end of the car, someone laughed at a joke they couldn't hear. The toddler had fallen asleep; the rhythm against the rail had stopped.

"It's not…" He groped for a safer frame. "It's not like a flu."

"I know that," she said. "I read the same feeds you do. I sat through the same counselor who told me it's 'multifactorial' and 'manageable with support.'" She mimicked the Companion's neutral cadence a little too well. "That's not what I mean."

"Then what do you mean?" he asked, even though he already knew.

"I mean," she said, voice dropping, "do you ever wake up and think: this is the day my brain turns on me? That I'm going to open my eyes and see the world wrong and not be able to trust anything I feel?"

Jonah stared at their doubled faces: his pale and tired, hers pale and trying to look amused and not quite making it.

"Sometimes," he said.

There. Honest. A small thing.

"Same," she said, almost immediately, with an exhale that sounded like she'd been holding it since the doors closed behind them. "Sometimes I feel…" She shook her head, searching. "Too fast. Or too slow. Like everyone's moving through syrup and I'm on clear air, or the other way around. And I think: is this it? Is this the start?"

Her hands tightened on the rail until the tendons stood out.

"I watch myself," she added quietly. "All the time. It's exhausting."

Jonah's instinct was to tell her it was fine, that everyone felt like that sometimes, that the counselors were right and it was just stress from exams, from work, from living in a metal cylinder in the dark. Words lined up on his tongue, bland and safe.

He thought of her as a child, clinging to his hand in crowded corridors. Thought of Lydia at the kitchen table. Thought of the questions Companions had asked him in that careful tone that pretended not to be collecting data.

"They won't let you do hull work if they think you're unstable," he said instead. "You know that. They screen people three times over."

"So I should act more stable," she said. "Got it."

He winced. "That's not what I—"

"It's what everybody means," Alina said, but there was no heat in it, just tiredness. "Be fine. Or at least look fine. Otherwise the Ship decides you're one of the Ones Who Broke, and then what?"

The tunnel ended. Light rushed back in as the car emerged into a section with a broader view: the curve ahead dominated by a long strip of forest, dark green against soil and sky-panels. A glint of water cut through it like a scar.

"It's not that simple," Jonah said.

"I know," she said again. "I know it's not fair to blame the Ship for trying to keep us alive. I know Mom was sick before any of us were born. I know." She rapped her knuckles once against the rail. "Knowing doesn't make it feel less like there's a…timer. Or a coin flip."

He had no argument that didn't sound like something a Companion would say. Risk profiles. Early interventions. Multifactorial.

"I think about it," he admitted. "Some days more than others."

She let out a breath. "Okay."

"But," he added, because he had to give them something, "if it happens—if either of us ever…" He trailed off, the words refusing to form properly. Broke. Slipped. Cracked. None of them were right.

Alina spared him the effort. "If it happens," she said, "we don't walk away from each other."

The sentence hit him sideways. It wasn't a plea; it was a rule she was setting, quiet and absolute.

Images flashed up unbidden: the doorway of their childhood kitchen, the feel of the frame against his back as he stayed there, listening to Samuel find Lydia. His own promise, made in the dark years since, that he would never do that to anyone again.

"Yeah," he said. His voice came out rougher than he'd intended. "We don't walk away."

She turned her head just enough to meet his eyes directly instead of through the reflection.

"Even if it's scary," she said.

"Especially then."

For a moment, something uncoiled in her shoulders. She rested her forehead briefly against the rail, then straightened.

"Cool," she said, as if they'd just decided which food cart to try. "That's settled, then."

The car chimed, announcing the next stop. People shifted, gathering bags, corralling children. The world outside continued its endless, familiar spin.

"You should come visit my sector sometime," Alina said. "See something that isn't a readout. There’s a stairwell that looks straight down three decks. You'd hate it."

"Great sales pitch," Jonah said.

"You love hating things," she replied.

The doors slid open with a soft rush. As the crowd flowed toward the exit, Alina slipped ahead of him, light on her feet, then turned back long enough to catch his gaze and tap two fingers against the rail between them—a small, private echo of their earlier promise.

Jonah touched the same spot after she moved away, as if he could press the agreement into the metal and let the Ship remember it for them.

Then he followed her out into the station, carrying the faint, unwelcome awareness that when he worried about losing his mind, he no longer pictured only himself.
