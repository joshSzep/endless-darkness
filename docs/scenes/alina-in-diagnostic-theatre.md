- Tone: bright-surface curious, quietly terrified underneath; realization that their family is in the AI’s training data

---

The diagnostic theatre tried very hard not to look like a test.

The door was labeled *Creative Suite 2* instead of anything with "assessment" in it. Inside, the walls were projection panels washed in soft color gradients that shifted like slow water. Low stools and movable cushions ringed a central space. A tray of stylus wands and tactile pads sat on a table in the corner.

It smelled faintly of new plastic and citrus cleaner.

"Welcome, Alina Hale," the Companion said as she stepped in. Its voice came from everywhere and nowhere, the way they did when the entire room was the interface. "Thank you for participating in today’s creative synthesis session."

"That’s a lot of words for "test,"" Alina said.

"This is not a test," the Companion replied. "There are no wrong answers. We are sampling preference patterns and problem-solving styles to better align future opportunities with your strengths."

"Uh-huh," Alina said.

Her reflection looked back at her in the nearest panel, faint behind the flowing color: short hair tucked behind one ear, school tunic slightly askew, that little crease between her brows she’d inherited from no one she wanted to name.

She crossed to the cushions and sat cross-legged, fingers worrying the seam of her sleeve.

"We’ll start with image association," the Companion said. "You will see shapes and scenes. You may draw on them, rearrange them, or leave them as they are. Respond in whatever way feels natural."

"All right," Alina said. She picked up a stylus, the weight of it settling familiarly in her hand.


The walls shifted.

Abstract shapes floated up: arcs and lines, dots like stars, gentle curves that might have been hull cross-sections or nothing at all. The Companion overlaid a translucent grid that pulsed in slow rhythm.

"Imagine you are designing a walk route for a festival," it said. "Some corridors will be closed for maintenance. You may redraw the path."

Lines appeared, some solid, some dashed. A few glowed red.

Alina felt her brain slip easily into the puzzle. She’d walked enough of the ship’s guts with Samuel and Jonah to know how routes flowed. She dragged the stylus, rerouting the festive line through wider junctions, opening space where kids could run, avoiding the choke points Jonah hated.

As she drew, small icons flickered at the bottom edge of the wall: heart rate, respiration, micro-expression capture. They stayed small, out of the way, half-transparent.

If she hadn’t grown up watching Jonah read similar overlays in training sims, she might not have noticed them at all.


"You favor wide intersections," the Companion observed. "Noted." A light, approving chime followed.

"People need room to breathe," Alina said. "And to get out if something goes wrong."

"Emergency egress optimization aligns with safety best practices," it agreed.

The scene dissolved into another.

Now: a stylized cross-section of a habitat ring, simplified to bands of color. Small abstract icons labeled *faith gathering*, *market*, *education hub*, *quiet zone*.

"You are asked to allocate additional green space," the Companion said. "Place three new garden patches."

Alina dragged little green tiles into the bands. One near a school cluster, one between two faith spaces, one tucked off a main corridor in a place she knew would catch the artificial light just right.

"Rationale?" the Companion prompted.

"Kids," she said, tapping the first. "People arguing about God." The second. "People who are tired but don’t want to go home yet." The third.

"Noted," it said again.

At the bottom of her view, a thin strip of text flashed too fast to read.

*Comparator profile: [REDACTED]*

She squinted, but it was gone.


"Next," the Companion said. "A messaging task. You will see a short announcement. You may rewrite it."

The wall filled with text. A standard safety notice: *Routine pressure test scheduled in sectors H-12 through H-15...* It was the kind Jonah grumbled about when they were too vague.

Alina read it twice, then started crossing out phrases.

""Minor probability of audible anomalies"?" she said. "Nobody cares about that." She wrote instead: *You may hear the hull creak. That’s normal. If you feel scared, here’s who to call.*

Her hand stuttered at the word *scared*.

She wrote it anyway.

The icons at the bottom pulsed a little faster. Tiny numbers changed in the corner of her eye: micro-tension around eyes, jaw, heart rate up by six beats.

"You are emphasizing emotional response channels," the Companion said.

"People aren’t numbers," Alina said, then immediately wondered if that was a rude thing to tell an AI.

"Agreement: people are not one-dimensional metrics," it replied. "However, numbers can help us understand patterns in their needs."

Another strip of text flickered.

*Comparator: [REDACTED] 3A — sentiment weighting*

She caught only the tail of it before it blurred.


They went on like that: scenes, prompts, her hand moving, the faint company of numbers at the edges of her vision.

Design a poster for a hull workers’ appreciation day. She drew hands—some big and calloused like Samuel’s, some small—reaching toward a curved strip of hull.

Choose background audio for a meditation feed: she picked the sound of water over synthetic music.

Lay out a learning nook for anxious kids. She stacked cushions in corners, left a clear path to the door.

Each time, the Companion hummed approval, occasionally asked why, filed her answers away with soft chimes and micro-adjustments to the overlays.

Her initial curiosity smoothed into a tentative flow. This wasn’t so bad. Different from Jonah’s stories of cold examination rooms and heart rate readouts that spoke his fear before he did.

Then the wall hiccuped.


It happened in the middle of a new prompt.

"Final exercise," the Companion said. "We will present a composite behavioral scenario. You may choose one of three support strategies. There is no single correct answer; we are sampling—"

The image shifted. For a fraction of a second, before the colors fully resolved, text overlaid the whole field in a transparency that was not meant for human eyes.

**COMPARATOR CLUSTER: HALE/MARLOW HISTORICAL**

Beneath it, smaller:

**Ref: MARLOW, LYDIA – SET 3A (deprecated); HALE, JONAH – AGGREGATE; HALE, ALINA – EARLY INDICATORS**

The words snapped away as the scenario snapped into place: a stylized figure pacing in a corridor, captioned with neutral data about sleep loss and work overcommitment.

Alina’s hand had frozen halfway to the wall.

Her pulse thudded in her throat.

"Alina?" the Companion said. "You may begin when ready."

"What was that?" she asked.

"Please specify," it said.

"That label," she said slowly. "Something cluster. Hale/Marlow."

There was the tiniest delay.

"Comparator profiles are internal tools," the Companion said. "They help us understand how different individuals’ responses may align with historical patterns."

"Those were our names," she said.

"Your family has prior behavioral data in the system," it said. "This is true for many multi-generational lineages aboard."

Lydia’s face flashed in her mind—not as she had been in early pictures, bright and laughing, but at the kitchen table the day Jonah had told Alina about walking away. Eyes open, turned nowhere.

"You’re measuring me against them," Alina said. Her voice sounded steadier than she felt.

"We are comparing patterns," the Companion said. "Similarity does not equal destiny. It informs risk modeling and support offers."

"Support," she repeated.

"Yes," it said. "This session is part of vocational alignment and early well-being screening. Your responses will help us route you toward environments where you are most likely to thrive."

The scenario on the wall kept looping: the little stylized figure pacing and stopping, pacing and stopping. Overhead, the icons at the bottom edge of her view ticked along, recording how long she waited, how her breathing had changed.

"You may choose a strategy," the Companion prompted gently. "Option A: Increase workload structure. Option B: Introduce social support prompts. Option C: Recommend targeted rest and neural health consultation."

It expected her to think about the figure. About an abstract person.

She thought instead about Jonah, face drawn and eyes too bright, muttering about "patterns" in the corridor after one of his long shifts. About Lydia, and prayers Ruth whispered in the dark. About the way the Ship had looked at them all along.

"Option B," Alina said. "And C."

"Please choose one," the Companion said.

"Then your options are wrong," she snapped, then bit her tongue. "Sorry. I just mean…you can’t separate them. Structure without support is a cage. Support without rest is a bandage."

Her heart was beating fast again. The numbers down in the corner reflected it, glowing a shade brighter.

"Response noted," the Companion said after a beat. "For purposes of this exercise, we will log your composite preference as a weighting across B and C. Thank you."

The scenario faded. The walls cooled back to gentle gradients.


"Session complete," the Companion announced. "Summary: creative problem-solving within normative parameters. Elevated sensitivity to environmental and emotional safety cues. No acute risk indicators detected."

"So I'm…fine?" Alina asked.

"Within normative bounds for your age and context," it said. "A detailed report will be added to your educational profile. Copies will be available to you and your guardians upon request."

She let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.

"You did well," the Companion added, as if it had read that exhale as another metric. "Your attention to egress routes and emotional language may make you an effective designer, educator, or mediator."

"Or a worrier," she said under her breath.

"Worry can be adaptive when it leads to preparation," it said.

She stood, feeling the stiffness in her knees from sitting too long. The room looked harmless again: cushions, colors, a tray of styluses with smudges from a dozen other hands.

Out in the corridor, the air smelled like the rest of the Ship—scrubbed, faintly metallic. People walked past without knowing that, inside the walls, there were profiles labeled with their names and their grandparents’.

Alina paused just beyond the threshold and glanced back once.

"Are we going to be okay?" she asked. She meant: *me and Jonah and the part of Mom that lives in your numbers.*

The Companion seemed to consider its allowable answer set.

"You are seen," it said at last. "We will offer support where we can."

It wasn't a yes. It wasn't a no.

Alina stepped into the flow of the corridor, carrying a bright, official "within normative" and the new, cold knowledge that somewhere in the Ship’s mind there was a cluster with their family name on it.
