### Concept
Alina is invited to a "creative aptitude" session in a diagnostic theatre—projection walls, drawing surfaces, Companion-guided improvisation. As she sketches and reacts to simulated ship anomalies, subtle overlays track micro-expressions and stress markers. Terror is quiet: she realizes the patterns mirror tests Jonah described, and she glimpses a redacted reference to his profile as a comparative template. The ship is measuring whether she shares the Hale/Marlow instability. She leaves with a "within normative" report but a new awareness that their family’s storms live in the AI’s training data.
