The stairwell between bands C and D was officially "service access only."

No one had ever stopped Alina from using it.

Jonah found her there halfway down the flight, sitting on the middle landing with her back against the bulkhead and one knee pulled up, boot tapping the grated step in a restless rhythm. The light here was a little too bright, an uncompromising white that made the scuffs on the metal look like old bruises.

"You’re blocking emergency egress," he said, pausing two steps above her.

"I’m an artistic obstruction," she said without looking up. "Part of the ambiance."

She had a stylus in her hand, the tip clicking against the side of a small slate she’d propped on her other knee. From where he stood he could see only quick, jagged lines—loops of corridors, maybe, or waves.

"You missed the lift," he said. "On purpose?"

"The lift missed me," she said. Then, finally, she tilted her head back to look at him. "You’re sweaty."

"Thank you," he said. "I came straight from a node."

"Your sacrifice is noted," she said.

He hesitated a beat, then sat beside her, leaving one stair between them as a buffer. The metal was cool through his work pants.

"You’re supposed to be in class," he said.

"I was," she said. "Then I was in the nice "this is not a test" room with the friendly walls. Now I’m here." She clicked the stylus again. "Figured you’d find me eventually."

"You pinged me four times," he said.

"True," she said. "But you could have ignored me. That would have been a character choice."

He rubbed the back of his neck, aware of a faint itch along his nerves that wasn’t quite anxiety, wasn’t quite calm.

"How was the nice not-a-test room?" he asked.

"Soothing," she said, dragging the word out. "They gave me colors and pretend problems and kept smiling like I was a particularly interesting insect." She made a quick, exaggerated sketch of a bug with too many eyes, then scrubbed it away.

"Did they call it creative diagnostics?" he asked.

"Creative Suite," she said. "Because "Suite" sounds like a place you get fruit. Did you have that one?"

"No," he said. "My generation got "Aptitude Chambers.""

"Bleak," she said. "Anyway. I solved their little scenario puzzles. Rerouted fake crowds. Chose between "everyone gets home tired" and "five people get home at all." You know. Casual."

He watched her profile as she talked. The overhead strip etched a line of light along her cheekbone. She had their mother’s brow, that faint knot even when she was joking.

"And?" he asked.

She flicked the stylus against the slate, the click sharp in the narrow space.

"And," she said, "the walls told me I was Very Normal." The capital letters were audible. "Within acceptable variance. Good at thinking about other people. Recommended for roles that "support system-wide wellbeing."" She rolled her eyes. "Do I get a sticker for that?"

"Sometimes they send a commendation to your parents," he said.

"Fantastic," she said. "Dad can pin it next to all the "didn’t fall out an airlock" awards."

He smiled despite himself.

"Did they…" He searched for a non-leading way to ask. "Say anything else?"

"You mean besides the part where they compared me to a ghost?" she asked lightly.

His stomach did a slow, unpleasant turn.

"Alina," he said.

"Relax," she said. "It wasn’t like that. Not exactly." She shifted, resting her forearms on her knees. "There was a glitch. You would have loved it."

"Tell me anyway," he said.

"You ever see behind the glass when they think you’re not looking?" she asked.

"Sometimes," he said.

"One of the walls went transparent for a second," she said. "Not literally. The overlay. I saw my little icon up there, and below it a label." She drew a rectangle in the air. "Comparator cluster: HALE/MARLOW HISTORICAL." She pronounced it in the flat Companion cadence.

He felt the words like a weight on his sternum.

"You’re sure?" he asked.

"I do know how to read," she said. The crack in her voice betrayed her. "Then it snapped back to "within normative range" and a picture of a garden for "calming visualization."" She snorted. "Very subtle."

He stared at the scuffed riser opposite them.

"I didn’t know they put it in writing like that," he said.

"You knew something," she said. "You’d gone all thoughtful and twitchy when I told you they wanted me in the fun room." She tilted her head. "How long have you known we’re a cluster?"

He opened his mouth, then closed it.

"There was…" He swallowed. "An evaluation. A while back. They pulled up old logs. Mine, but also child assessments. Lydia’s. Tag words." He forced himself to meet her eyes. "They’ve been watching our line for a long time."

"Because we’re so charming," she said.

"Because we light up their risk charts," he said.

"Delightful," she said. She leaned her head back against the bulkhead with a soft thud. "I thought I was imagining it. The way the questions felt…weighted. But no, of course not. Of course it’s in a model somewhere." She mimed a Companion voice again. "Subject exhibits HALE/MARLOW tendencies. Recommend additional supervision, strategic routing, and fresh vegetables."

"They like vegetables," he said.

"We all like vegetables," she said. "We’re on a tin can in space."

They sat in a thin band of silence. A group passed two levels above them, footsteps ringing through the metal. Somewhere lower, a door thumped open and shut.

"Does it scare you?" he asked at last. "Knowing they wrote it down."

"Which part?" she asked. "That they see me? That they see you? That they see us as a unit?" She shook her head. "It's like having a mirror in a room you didn’t agree to put a mirror in. I keep catching myself at weird angles."

He pictured the Lydia simulation he’d never seen but now knew existed: his mother reduced to data points, overlaid with his own. Now Alina’s trace added to the same composite.

"I worry," he said, "that they’ll decide we’re…too much. As a pattern. That we’re more trouble than we’re worth."

"I worry," she said, "that they’ll decide we’re exactly what they were built to manage and pat themselves on the back for catching us early." She nudged his boot with hers. "Same storm, different spin."

He let out a breath that bordered on a laugh.

"You’re not nothing but a risk profile," he said.

"Neither are you," she said. "Unfortunately, we have to keep reminding the invisible committee of that." She flicked the stylus against his shoulder. "Look at me."

He did.

"Do I seem like someone about to disintegrate?" she asked. Her eyes were brighter than her voice.

"No," he said. "You seem like someone using humor as a defense mechanism."

"Rude," she said. "Where do you think I learned that?"

"Dad," he said automatically.

She snorted. "Fair." Her expression softened. "Also you."

He looked away, throat tight.

"If they start treating you differently," he said, "if Companions get weird, you tell me."

"Define weird," she said. "They’re already weird."

"You know what I mean," he said. "Extra check-ins. Routes that don’t make sense. Too many "are you okay" surveys."

"Jonah," she said. "You can’t stand the idea of me being watched like you are."

"I can live with me being watched," he said. "I signed up to sit on the nerve clusters. I knew I'd get tags. You didn’t ask for it like this."

"I asked to be born to interesting people," she said. "This is the cost." She bumped his shoulder with hers. "Besides, if I’m going to be a data point, I’d rather be one that keeps you alive."

He blinked. "That’s not how it works."

"Isn’t it?" she asked. "If they see me holding it together, maybe they give you a little more credit. Or they realize the story isn’t "Hale men are doomed."" She shrugged. "Maybe I get to tilt the graph."

The idea landed strangely—a reversal of the pattern where his storms defined the family. Alina as counter-weight.

"You shouldn’t have to," he said.

"Shouldn’t is a weak word in a ship like this," she said. "We live in what is." She twisted the stylus between her fingers. "What is: I am fine, mostly. What is: you are…not fine, but working on it. What is: the Ship is watching us, and I’d rather look back than pretend it isn’t."

He exhaled through his nose.

"You sound like Ruth," he said.

"She taught us both to talk to walls," Alina said. "I’m just choosing better words."

He laughed, brief and helpless.

"Say it," she said.

"Say what?" he asked.

"Say that if the Ship gets weird, you’ll tell me," she said. "Not just the other way around. We’re in the same cluster, apparently. Might as well act like it."

He stared at the opposite wall for a long moment.

"If it starts pushing too hard," he said slowly, "if it reroutes me in ways that don’t feel like support, I’ll…" The word stuck. "I’ll say something. To you."

"Good," she said. "Then we can compare notes and complain artistically."

"Complain artistically," he repeated.

"Yeah," she said. She drew a quick, looping pattern on the slate—purple lines against gray. "I’ll make a whole series. "Portrait of a Family As Interlocking Risk Indices." Very niche audience."

He shook his head, smiling despite the sourness in his gut.

"You’re impossible," he said.

"You’re stuck with me," she said. "Cluster life."

Above them, a lift chimed, doors opening with a soft sigh. Voices rose and fell. Life went on along its rails.

For a moment, sitting in the harsh light of the service stairwell with his sister’s shoulder a deliberate weight against his, Jonah felt the model loosen by a fraction—not just HALE/MARLOW as a red-flag label, but as two people refusing, together, to be only the worst lines in the Ship’s file.
