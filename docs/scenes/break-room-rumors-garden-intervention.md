The hydroponics break room had never deserved the name.

It was a narrow wedge of space carved out between two nutrient mains, just wide enough for a table, three mismatched chairs, and a bank of old dispensers that wheezed out tea and thick, beige nutrient bars. The air tasted faintly of old leaves and the metallic tang of the pipes that ran through the walls.

Sera sat at the far end of the table with her boots hooked around the rung of her chair, hands cupped around a mug that had long since stopped steaming. Damp patches marked her sleeves where a mist nozzle had misbehaved earlier.

The Companion node above the door glowed a soft, unobtrusive green, like an eye pretending to be closed.

"I'm just saying," Kira said around a mouthful of bar, "if the Ship can route an AI engineer to "behavioral health optimization" like it's a shift assignment, it could at least find someone to fix the tea unit." She slapped the side of the dispenser for emphasis. It whined and spat a thin trickle into her cup.

"Careful," Morrow said from the chair opposite Sera. "It might decide your caffeine dependence is a risk factor and reroute you to a nap pod." He grinned, wide and crooked.

"If the Ship wants to babysit me that badly, it can start with my laundry," Kira said. She tipped her cup back, made a face. "Ugh. This tastes like the inside of a pipe." She glanced at Sera. "No offense."

"Pipes are innocent," Sera said. "They carry what we give them."

"Poetic," Morrow said. He nudged the half-empty tray of cut fruit toward her. "You eat? You’ve been running since second shift."

"In a minute," she said.

Her head still hummed from the earlier intervention: the way the Companion had quietly flagged Jonah as pre-critical, the rerouting notice that had popped up in her feed like any other resource allocation. **BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OPTIMIZATION: ASSIGN SUBJECT HALE, JONAH – AI ENGINEER (TIER 3) TO HYDROPONICS SECTOR G-3.** Neat font, no drama.

The reality of it had not been neat.

"So," Kira said, leaning her elbows on the table. "Is it true he just…appeared?"

"Who?" Morrow asked. "The ghost in the pipes?"

"The engineer," Kira said. "The one from the evaluation rumors. Jonah." She said his name like testing a foreign word. "One minute we’re arguing about root depth, next minute my Companion pings me that we’ve been selected for "stabilizing exposure.""

"He was on my shift," Morrow said. "Tall. Looked like he hadn’t slept since launch." He mimed wide, frantic eyes. "Companion introduced him like a new nutrient cycle. "Subject Hale, Jonah – AI Engineer." Very comforting."

Sera rolled the mug between her palms.

"He walked in," she said, "looked at the moisture graphs, and apologized to the peppers." 

Kira snorted. "That sounds about right."

"He did good work," Sera added. "Recalibrated the faulty valves in row six in half the time it would’ve taken me alone."

"He also nearly jumped out of his skin when the emergency strip flickered," Morrow said.

"That strip always flickers," Kira said.

"Exactly," Morrow said. "We ignore it. He didn’t. Companion pinged him three times to breathe." He waggled his eyebrows. "Pre-critical, right? That’s the word going around."

The word landed in the air like a dropped tool.

"You shouldn’t throw that around like gossip," Sera said.

"It’s not gossip if the Ship says it out loud," Kira argued. "My Companion literally said "subject is trending pre-critical" in my ear while I was pruning. If that's not a rumor starter, I don’t know what is."

"Companions shouldn’t be giving you diagnostic labels about other people," Sera said.

"Tell that to the network," Morrow said. "It flagged him and dropped him in our lap like a misdelivered crate. "Here, gardens, hold this unstable variable for a bit.""

Sera’s jaw tightened.

"He’s not a variable," she said. "He’s a person."

"He’s a person the Ship has a lot of graphs about," Kira said. "That’s what scares me." She jabbed a thumb toward the node over the door. "If it can pull strings like that for him, it can do it for anybody. "Oh, Kira, your stress indices are rising, let’s send you to scrub algae for a while."" She shuddered theatrically. "No thank you."

"Algae’s honest work," Morrow said.

"Algae smells like the inside of my boots," Kira said. "I prefer peppers."

Sera took a slow sip of her too-cool tea. It tasted like overused filters and someone else’s exhaustion.

"The routing could have been worse," she said. "They could have left him on the nodes." She set the mug down. "He was…overclocked. You saw it. If the choice is between him unraveling alone at a console or in a place where other people can notice, I’ll take the latter."

"Sure," Morrow said. "Until he has an episode in your sector and the review board starts asking why we let a pre-critical engineer near the nutrient mains." He tapped the table. "We get to carry that too."

"You think they’re going to blame us?" Kira asked.

"They always blame somebody," Morrow said. "If the Ship screws up, it calls it an optimization error and "updates safeguards." If a human screws up, it calls it a report and hangs it on a wall for training."

Sera thought of Jonah’s face when the Companion had used that word—optimization—for him. The way his shoulders had gone a fraction tighter, as if someone had added weight without asking.

"He didn’t screw up today," she said.

"Yet," Morrow said.

"You sound like the rumors," Sera said.

"I am the rumors," Morrow said with a half-grin. "I hear things." He ticked them off on his fingers. "That he integrated too well in his last eval. That the Ship flagged him as both "asset" and "liability" in the same breath. That he hears the hull talk back. That he’s on somebody’s watch list." He shrugged. "Hard to tell where the logs end and the superstition starts."

"People said plenty about Lydia too," Kira muttered. "Not all of it kind." She shot Sera a quick look, half-apologetic.

"Yeah," Sera said. Her voice came out flatter than she intended. "And none of that gossip helped when it mattered."

Silence settled for a moment. Somewhere in the pipes, a pump kicked on, the vibration running up through the soles of their boots.

"Do you trust it?" Kira asked suddenly.

"The tea unit?" Morrow said.

"The Ship," she said. "To know where to send people like him. Like us."

Sera traced the rim of her mug with one thumb.

"I trust it to follow its models," she said carefully. "I don’t always trust the models." She exhaled. "But I’ve seen it catch people we might have missed. And I’ve seen it miss people we should have seen."

"Comforting," Kira said dryly.

"I trust you," Sera added, meeting Kira’s eyes, then Morrow’s. "To say something if I start pacing the aisles at three in the morning talking to the lettuces."

"I’d say something if you did that anyway," Morrow said.

"Exactly," she said. "The Ship routes. We still have to notice each other."

Kira let out a breath that might have been a laugh.

"Fine," she said. "If I ever get the "behavioral health optimization" ping, I’ll come sit in your jungle and complain until you kick me out."

"Deal," Sera said.

The Companion node over the door pulsed once, a soft acknowledgment.

"Routing stability for hydroponics staff remains within normative range," it said. "Peer support is a recognized protective factor."

"Don’t you start," Kira said, pointing her cup at it. "We were having a perfectly good wallow without your input."

"Input withdrawn," the AI said.

Morrow laughed.

Sera allowed herself a small smile.

Outside, beyond the thin wall of the break room, rows of green stretched out under steady light. Somewhere in the Ship’s deeper bands, Jonah Hale’s name sat in a model as a pre-critical flag, a line in a risk curve. In here, he was a man who had asked the peppers how they were doing and flinched at a flicker.

Both could be true.

"Shift’s not over," she said, pushing her chair back. Her legs ached when she stood. "Come on. The plants will gossip about us if we’re late."

"Plants are snitches," Kira said.

"And honest," Sera said. "Let’s try to be at least one of those."

They filed back out into the corridor, the break-room door hissing shut behind them. The Companion’s light stayed green, watching them go.
