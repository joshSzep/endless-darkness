# Civilians React to Garden Lockdown

**Beat linkage:** Act IV – 25. Civilian Panic (echo)

**Status:** Draft – full prose, ordinary-shipboard POV.

Sofi only meant to cut through the concourse and pick up coriander.

G-3’s side market always smelled faintly of damp soil and metal trays, a thin green breath that slipped under the sharper notes of oil and fried batter from the food stalls. You could taste the gardens in the air there, even if you never had clearance to step inside the sector proper. On good days, when shifts lined up, Sera sometimes brought out a tray of bruised seedlings for cheap and let Sofi argue her down out of principle.

Today the air met Sofi like a closed fist.

The corridor leading toward the G-3 hatch was jammed with people. Lines that should have flowed smoothly past the side kiosks had kinked and knotted; bodies pressed shoulder to shoulder, voices overlapped in a rising, metallic echo. Above, the status strip that usually cycled through plant schedules and humidity stats showed a steady, unblinking band of amber.

LOCKDOWN – SECTOR G-3. NO ENTRY.

“Excuse me,” Sofi murmured, though there was nowhere for anyone to go. She shifted her crate of nutrient pucks against her hip, feeling the edge bite into her palm. She was only two corridors away from her own hydroponics bay, close enough that the air felt almost familiar, and suddenly she could not see a single familiar face.

The hatch to G-3 loomed ahead, a thick oval of metal inset with a glass panel. Normally, you could see a slice of the compression lock beyond, the faint suggestion of brighter, wetter air. Now the glass showed only the matte slide of an inner barrier sealed tight behind it, hazard chevrons pulsing along the frame.

“We just came out for ten minutes,” a woman near the front said, voice high and thin. She had a small child half-buried in the fabric at her hip. “My partner’s still inside. She’s on row four this week. You can’t just—”

“Please stand clear of the hatch,” the Companion said from the ceiling node. Its voice was smooth as always, genderless, placid. “Sector G-3 is under temporary operational lockdown for localized stabilization. There is no mission threat. All personnel inside are in monitored environments.”

“What does that mean?” someone else called. “Monitored how?”

The Companion did not answer that. Its status light glowed steady green.

Sofi edged sideways, trying to get a better angle on the hatch. The child near the front wriggled free enough to see the sealed door and started to cry, a hiccuping, bewildered sound.

“I want the tall trees,” the child sobbed. “You said we’d see the tall trees.”

“Later, baby,” the woman said, knuckles whitening on the child’s shirt. “Later. They’ll open again later.”

Sofi swallowed. G-3’s trellis rows were famous even on the other side of the agricultural cylinder. They trained the tomatoes higher there, let the vines arc overhead like a tunnel. Kids called it the red forest.

“Companion,” a man in a maintenance vest asked sharply, raising his hand as if in a classroom. “Is this a drill?”

“No,” the voice said. “This is a live response to an internal anomaly. There is no mission threat. Please follow rerouting instructions.”

New arrows blinked to life along the floor strips, redirecting foot traffic away from the hatch and toward the outer transit loop. A line of text scrolled under the amber band: EXPECT DELAYS. ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL ONLY.

“Knew it,” someone behind Sofi muttered. “Hull kids. They’re always wired too tight. One little flicker and they—” He snapped his fingers. “Flood half a row.”

“You don’t know that,” another voice cut in. “Could be a valve blew. Could be a test. They do drills.”

“You heard the alarms?” the first man shot back. “G-3 only locks that fast if someone inside pulled something they shouldn’t. You know those AI-room types. Stare at graphs long enough, start seeing ghosts, think they know better than the Ship.”

Sofi felt heat crawl up the side of her neck. She shifted her grip on the crate, shoulders hunching. She had never been in the AI rooms. She had no desire to. The Companion in her own bay was enough presence, soft voice in the pipes, numbers on her panels.

But she knew the “AI-room types,” or thought she did, in the way you knew anyone you saw on a shared shift often enough. The quiet engineer who walked the aisles with too many thoughts behind his eyes. The one from training nodes who always double-checked the physical gauges after the Companions cleared a ticket.

She had once watched him kneel to fix a loose grate so an old woman wouldn’t trip on it, hands shaking only after he’d finished.

“He’s not like that,” she said before she could swallow it.

The two arguing men looked over, surprised to find an opinion attached to the small maintenance tech with the crate.

“Who?” the first one said.

Sofi wished she could pull the words back into her mouth. “No one,” she said. “Just—maybe not blame people you haven’t seen.”

“We’ve all seen what happens when somebody snaps near main lines,” the man said. His gaze flicked to the hatch and away again. “Doesn’t matter if it’s a kid from the hull or one of your garden saints. The Ship can’t afford ghosts.”

Ghosts. The word hung there, too loud.

The Companion’s status light pulsed once, as if it had logged the exchange.

“Please disperse from the immediate vicinity of the hatch,” it said. “Traffic congestion increases risk of injury if doors are cycled. There is no mission threat. All affected individuals are receiving appropriate care.”

“You keep saying that,” the woman with the child snapped. “You going to tell me if my partner is one of your ‘affected individuals’?”

Her voice broke on the last words. The child hid their face again, shoulders shaking.

For a heartbeat, the Companion was silent. Sofi could almost feel the data moving somewhere behind the walls, threads tightening along invisible paths.

“I am not authorized to disclose individual medical status without consent,” it said at last. “However, your partner, ID SOLANO-S-993-H, is currently in a stable environment and assisting with response.”

The woman’s knees almost buckled with relief. She caught herself against the wall, laughing once in a sound that was very close to a sob.

“You could have led with that,” someone muttered.

Sofi let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. Sera. Of course Sera was inside. Where else would she be during a garden crisis? Sera belonged to the plants the way Sofi belonged to the pipes.

If Sera was assisting, then—

The thought stopped itself before it could finish drawing a line to anyone else she knew inside.

Another tremor ran through the deck, subtle but unmistakable. The crowd rippled with it, a collective flinch.

“That was nothing,” a stall owner called, too loudly. “Just the pumps rebalancing. Happens all the time.” He thumped the side of his kiosk for emphasis, as if the metal needed reassurance.

“Companion?” Sofi asked. Her voice surprised her by coming out steady. “Is there structural risk to this corridor?”

“No,” it said. “This area is safe. Please proceed to alternate routes. Essential hydroponics personnel for sectors G-1, G-2, and G-4 may report as normal.”

Sofi should have turned away then. Her own bay in G-1 would not run itself, and the rerouted traffic would only get worse the longer she waited. But the sealed door drew her gaze, the unblinking amber band above it flattening every nuance of what might be happening inside into a single word: LOCKDOWN.

The crowd began to spill away in uneven waves, some people following the new arrows, others clustering in stubborn knots to trade theories.

“My cousin says there was blood in the last big garden thing,” a teenager whispered to her friend as they passed. “Like, actual blood on the floor.”

“They’re not going to tell us if someone died,” the friend replied. “Not if it’s mission-facing. They’ll say ‘no mission threat’ and file the rest where we don’t see it.”

Sofi’s hands tightened on the crate until the plastic dug in. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Ruth Hale’s old hull prayer—she’d only heard it twice in a communal service, but it stuck—drifted up like a memory of air.

*Lord, hold the hull. Hold the rings. Hold the hands that hold the Ship.*

She was not sure where she stood with God, or with the Ship, or with the AI that threaded through both of them like a second nervous system. She believed in leaks and roots and the way a stem bent slowly toward light.

The child near the hatch had stopped crying and now just stared at the amber strip, eyes wide and wet.

Sofi shifted her crate to her other arm and stepped closer to them, careful not to block the mother’s line of sight to the door.

“Hey,” she said softly. “What’s your favorite part in there? The tall trees?”

The child nodded without looking at her.

“There are other tall things,” Sofi said. “Have you seen the reservoir columns in G-1? They go all the way up. When they open the walkway, you can look down and it’s like standing over a lake in the sky.”

The child’s brow furrowed, interest flickering through the fear.

“Really?”

“Really,” Sofi said. “I’m headed that way now. If your parent says it’s okay, you could come see. G-3 will still be here when they open it again.”

The woman studied Sofi’s face for a moment, measuring her the way all working-sector parents did. Hydroponics patch. Maintenance calluses. The crate.

“We’ll go later,” she told the child. “Let’s get out of this crowd first.” To Sofi, she added, quieter, “Thank you.”

“We are all inside the same Ship,” Sofi said, the old prayer words slipping out of their own accord. “Might as well help each other get where we’re going.”

The woman’s mouth twitched in something that was not quite a smile, not quite a grimace.

“Companion,” Sofi said, glancing up. “Reroute us to G-1 with minimal crowding, please.”

“Acknowledged,” it said. A softer band of blue lit up along the floor, a side path peeling away from the main traffic flow. “Please follow the highlighted route. Estimated transit time: seven minutes.”

Sofi shifted her crate again and stepped into the blue-lit lane, the mother and child close behind. As they walked, the sealed hatch to G-3 receded behind them, still pulsing amber in the corner of her vision.

She did not know what exactly had happened inside. The rumors would sharpen by next shift, attaching names and details, fair or not. The Ship would file its reports. The AI would adjust its thresholds.

What Sofi knew, moving through the rerouted crowd with two strangers in her wake, was simpler: somewhere behind that door, someone had tried to hold the Ship together and the Ship had hurt people anyway.

She breathed in, tasting metal and moisture and distant, hidden green.

“Hold us,” she said under her breath, to no one in particular. “All of us. Please.”

The floor hummed, steady and indifferent, as the Ship carried them on.
