# Community Bench After Shift — Post-Crisis Re‑Entry

**Beat linkage:** Act V – 37. Community Re‑entry (echo)

The bench had always been there, a simple strip of composite bolted to the wall opposite the G-3 access arch. Jonah had sat on it a hundred times over the years, half-listening to shift-change chatter while Sera scrubbed soil from her fingers or traded jokes with other stewards. It had been part of the background hum of his life, as dependable and featureless as the panel seams.

Now the bench felt like a spotlight.

He sat with his back against the cool wall, hands wrapped loosely around a dented mug of post-shift broth. The corridor smelled faintly of wet leaves and sanitizer, the ghosts of the flood still lingering no matter how many times the Companions cycled the air. The G-3 doors loomed a few meters away, their surface freshly resurfaced, the access strip glowing a calm, institutional green.

People moved past in little knots: stewards coming off rotation, families cutting through to the tram, a pair of nursery kids tugging at each other’s sleeves until a companion voice from the ceiling reminded them to mind the rail. Most of them glanced at the doors. Some glanced at him.

"Too much?" Sera asked softly.

She sat at the far end of the bench, angled toward the corridor, elbows on her knees. Her hands were empty; she’d finished her broth already and set the mug on the floor between her boots. The damp cuffs of her work pants were flecked with dried nutrient solution. Her hair was tied back in a knot that had started neat and surrendered somewhere around mid-shift.

"It's fine," Jonah said. His voice came out steady enough. The Companions would have marked it as within expected range.

"Fine," Sera repeated, but she didn't push. "We can go if you want. It's just a bench."

Just a bench, he thought, that has watched more of my life than some people.

A group of stewards clustered near the doors, waiting for the next crew to clear. Sofi was among them, her dark hair pulled under a net, sleeves rolled up past her elbows. She saw Jonah, hesitated, then raised a hand in a small, awkward wave.

He nodded back, a tiny tilt of his mug. Her shoulders eased by a degree. She said something to the steward next to her — a man Jonah didn't know well — and the man glanced over too. For a second Jonah braced for the look he’d seen before the medbay: pity, or fear, or that tight, controlled curiosity people got when they were trying to decide whether to ask about the incident.

Instead the man squinted and said, loud enough to carry, "You the one who caught the E-2 valve fault last year?"

The words hit Jonah like a soft impact.

"Uh," he said. "I was on that shift."

"Yeah." The man snapped his fingers once. "You yelled at the Companion because it wanted to keep the flow at nominal when the tone was wrong. Sofi told us." He jerked his chin toward the doors. "You saved my cousin’s rotation. That leak would’ve ruined half her row."

Heat crept up Jonah's neck. Sera’s head turned slightly, watching him but not interfering.

"It wasn’t just me," Jonah said. "The sensor flagged—"

"Sensor flagged late," Sofi cut in. "You heard it first."

There was a small murmur of agreement from the group. Someone else added, "Ship’s got good ears, but some of us have better." There was a ripple of tired laughter.

The moment passed. The doors cycled; the next crew filed through, boots leaving faint damp prints on the deck. Sofi gave Jonah one more quick look — not avoidance, not fascination, just recognition — and followed the others inside.

Jonah realized his grip on the mug had tightened. He forced his fingers to loosen.

"That was not how I expected that to go," he said.

"Me neither," Sera said. "Sofi can surprise you."

Another family passed: a woman with a sleeping toddler slumped against her shoulder, a teen dragging a crate on a little grav-sled behind them. The teen's eyes flicked to Jonah, lingered on the thin scar along his wrist where the medbay line had gone in, then slid away. No whisper. No pointing. Just the ordinary cataloguing of someone measuring the world.

"You don't have to catalog every glance," Sera murmured, as if reading his mind.

"Ship catalogs worse," Jonah said.

"Ship logs," she corrected. "You catalog. There's a difference."

He wanted to argue, but the words scattered before he could catch them. He took a sip of broth instead. It had gone lukewarm, the flavor a familiar blend of salt and something protein-adjacent. The warmth spread through his throat in a thin line, not quite reaching his chest.

A Companion announcement crackled softly from the overhead panel.

"Hydroponics sectors G-1 through G-4: post-incident safeguards review completed. Updated access tiers and emergency protocols now in effect. For details, please consult your sector schedules or speak to your supervising steward. Mission risk remains within acceptable parameters. Community risk support available upon request."

The voice did not say his name. It didn't have to. Conversations around the corridor dipped for a heartbeat, then resumed. Someone muttered, "There it is," under their breath. Someone else replied, "At least they finished before next planting."

Sera blew out a slow breath through her nose.

"Hate that phrase," she said.

"Which one?" Jonah asked. "Safeguards? Acceptable parameters? Community risk support?"

"Community risk support," she said. "Like we're all just indices." Her shoulder brushed his as she shifted, a small, grounding contact. "You want to go see the trellises after they reopen, or wait a few days?"

"I don't know yet," he said honestly.

"That's allowed," she said.

A pair of older workers he recognized from before the incident slowed as they neared the bench. One of them — Kira, with the line of old chemical burns along her left forearm — tipped her head toward Jonah.

"Hey," she said. "We’re short a set of ears on the C-2 pumps next week. Not yours," she added quickly, seeing his shoulders tense. "Just… if you feel up to walking the row with us. No panels. Just listening."

The offer hung there, simple and enormous.

"No pressure," her companion added. "We’ve got it covered. Just thought… you might like to hear something that isn’t a med monitor for a change."

Jonah's throat closed around the immediate surge of answer — yes, yes, I miss the pumps, I miss the way the Ship sings when it’s behaving. He forced himself to breathe.

"I'll think about it," he said.

"Thinking’s good," Kira said. "Ship could use more of it." She lifted two fingers in a casual salute and moved on.

Sera watched them go, then turned back to Jonah.

"You can say no," she reminded him.

"I know," he said. He stared into his mug. "I don't want them to…" He groped for the word. "To have to work around me."

"We're all working around each other," she said. "Around the Ship. Around the Companions. Around our own storms." She nudged his knee with hers. "You deserve to choose what you work around, too."

The announcement panel pinged again, this time in a softer tone.

"Post-incident wellness surveys are available for completion," the Companion said. "Your feedback helps us improve safeguards and support."

Jonah huffed a breath that was not quite a laugh.

"There's your favorite," he said.

"Mmm," Sera said. "I used to skip those."

"Used to?"

"Before," she said. Her gaze flicked to the G-3 doors and back. "Now I fill them out. I write paragraphs the Companions didn't ask for." Her mouth curved. "Sometimes I use your name."

He turned to look at her fully for the first time since they'd sat down.

"Why?"

"Because it’s harder to optimize you away if your story is tangled up in all their 'support metrics'," she said. "Because Ruth was right about talking to the walls. And because if they’re going to model community risk, they should remember community isn’t just something that gets hurt. It’s something that holds."

He swallowed. The corridor noise blurred at the edges, voices and footsteps and door chimes fading to a dull wash.

"And if they decide I'm too much risk anyway?" he asked. "If the next review says I can't be in the gardens at all? Or near the pumps?"

Sera's jaw tightened, but her eyes stayed on his.

"Then we will still be here," she said. "On benches, in corridors, in whatever spaces they think are 'low impact'. Samuel in the hull. Alina with her paints. Me with my stupid surveys. We will keep saying your name to each other and to the Ship until it has to carry you as a person and not just as a datapoint."

It sounded too big and too small at once, like all the promises people tried to make against vacuum and time. And yet: Jonah felt something in his chest shift fractionally, like a stuck valve easing.

A child broke away from a passing family then and stumbled toward the bench, chasing a rolling cup lid that had escaped their table. The lid skittered to a stop at Jonah's boot. He bent automatically, picked it up, and held it out.

"Here," he said.

The child — a little boy with hair in his eyes and a smear of nutrient gel on his cheek — took it solemnly.

"Thank you," he said, already half-turned back toward his parents. Then, as if remembering something, he looked up again. "My mama says you helped fix the water."

Jonah blinked.

"Your mama is very kind," he said.

"She says the Ship is kinder when we are," the boy said, parroting words clearly not his own. He grinned, gap-toothed, and ran back to his family.

Sera let out a breath that wobbled at the end.

"That's Ruth's line," Jonah said softly.

"Ruth's got better distribution than any Companion," Sera said.

They sat there a little longer, letting the corridor’s ordinary clatter wash over them: someone arguing mildly about shift rotations, someone complaining about the new safety drills, the hiss of a cleaning drone docking into its recess. The Ship’s hum threaded through it all, a low, steady presence.

For the first time since he’d watched himself on a medbay screen, Jonah let the sound settle without parsing it for threat. It was just there, same as the bench, same as the scuffed strip of floor where workers lined up their boots before going into G-3.

"We can go," Sera said eventually. "Before you run out of spoons." There was a faint smile in her voice.

"I thought the saying was 'run out of hours'," he said.

"Depends which part of you we're counting," she said.

He stood slowly. His legs ached, but it was the ache of use, not shock. The corridor seemed less like a gauntlet now, more like what it had always been: a place people passed through on their way to other work.

As they turned toward the tram, Jonah glanced back once at the G-3 doors. The access strip held steady at green. Behind it, new protocols and old soil waited. Maybe he would walk that row with Kira next week. Maybe he would just sit on this bench again and listen.

Either way, the Ship went on humming, carrying them all forward together.

For the first time in a long time, that forward motion felt like something he might be allowed to belong to.
