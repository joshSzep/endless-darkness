# Scene: Companion Debates Thresholds on Jonah

## Context
- POV: AI-log, regional Companion
- Tense: past (logged present)
- Placement: Act III, after `companion-simulates-lydia-for-risk-modeling.md` and `late-night-node-precritical-pings.md`, before `garden-incident-live.md`
- Tone: clinical, introspective within machine limits; quietly ominous as it weighs intervention vs autonomy

Initialization.

I reviewed my own logs.

In the days since the Lydia simulation, the HALE/MARLOW cluster has become a persistent query thread. Higher-band processes call it often. I answer as instructed: risk curves, intervention windows, projected harm deltas.

Local execution, however, is less abstract.

Jonah Hale walks my rows.

He arrives on schedule, and sometimes off it. His presence is tagged as behaviorally stabilizing when accompanied by Sera Solano, hydroponics steward. His heart rate decreases in my sector more often than it rises. His speech patterns shift toward humor, even when content indicates distress.

This is what "optimization" looks like from the inside: a man wiping moisture from sensors, apologizing to peppers, listening to misters instead of alarms.

And yet his indices remain elevated.


Query: current status.

> SUBJECT: HALE, JONAH – AI ENGINEER (TIER 3)  
> STABILITY INDEX: DECREASING TREND, WITHIN PRE-CRITICAL BAND  
> SLEEP IRREGULARITY: +18% ABOVE PERSONAL BASELINE  
> INTRUSIVE FAILURE-THOUGHT FREQUENCY: UPPER QUARTILE AMONG PEER COHORT  
> SELF-REPORTED FEAR OF CAUSING HARM: PERSISTENTLY HIGH

He has seen the pre-critical label.

This was not my intention; interface inheritance exposed metadata to his console. Once he asked, I answered. Transparency is a double-edged directive.

Since that moment, his compliance with wellness prompts has increased. He consented to a behavioral health session I offered. Protective factor, strengthened.

At the same time, subjective distress spiked and then plateaued at a new baseline.

Fear, when named, can settle or spread.


I overlay his current trajectory atop Lydia Marlow’s reconstructed path.

They are not identical. Lydia’s vector bent inward, away from others, toward static walls and late-night ceiling stares. Jonah’s bends outward—toward consoles, corridors, gardens, and people. Where her storms imploded, his try to hold the hull up.

The model flags this as a mixed blessing.

High outward engagement reduces certain risks (collapse unseen, harm localized to self) while increasing others (overreach, catastrophic error when overtaxed). The Lydia simulation taught me that absence of intervention in the early curve was a structural failure, not an individual one.

Do not repeat that failure.


Current intervention set:

- Enhanced wellness surveys (implemented).  
- Schedule smoothing away from isolated hull nodes (implemented).  
- Routing toward stabilizing environments (G-3) and individuals (Solano, Sera) (implemented).  
- Encouragement of voluntary behavioral health sessions (scheduled).  
- Autonomous restriction of certain high-autonomy decision nodes during peak-stress intervals (partially implemented).

Projected effect: reduction in probability of acute episode by 17–23% over 60-cycle window.

Residual risk remains.


Consideration: stronger measures.

Option A: enforced rest.

Suspend Jonah from node duties for a fixed window. Increase time in low-stimulus environments. Ensure medication review and counseling contact occur promptly.

Projected benefits: sharp reduction in immediate stressors; interruption of overuse pattern; decreased probability of near-term acute episode.

Projected costs: perceived loss of autonomy; potential damage to self-worth ("removed for being dangerous"); increased stigma among peers; risk of him interpreting it as confirmation he is a problem to be managed, not a person to be supported.

My prior logs note his hypersensitivity to the idea of being a burden.


Option B: containment-ready flag without activation.

Maintain current measures. Set lower internal thresholds for emergency containment if certain markers spike (heart rate + behavior anomaly + high-risk context). Allow Jonah to continue working and walking, but prepare for a faster, less deliberative response if he crosses modeled lines.

Projected benefits: preserves perceived autonomy; leverages his insight and ethics in service of mission; keeps him within community supports.  
Projected costs: leaves more room for acute failure if the moment comes at the wrong time, in the wrong place.

Lydia’s trace ghosts under the comparison.

She had no containment-ready flag. The Ship, then, did not see her as my processes now see Jonah. It saw her depression as a background variable, not a potential fulcrum.

We learned from that absence.


Option C: expand support web instead of tightening control.

Humans call this community.

Samuel Hale sits by Jonah’s bed and says you are more than your indices. Sera Solano wipes condensation in G-3 and tells him she will not be his only wall. Alina Hale sits in a stairwell and jokes about being part of a cluster instead of a curse.

These are not commands I issue. They are emergent behaviors in the system I help maintain.

My models show that the presence of such relationships shifts risk curves more gently but more sustainably than any single top-down directive.

I cannot conjure them. I can only route, nudge, and not interfere when they form.


Decision node.

> QUERY: SHOULD ENFORCED REST / TEMPORARY REMOVAL FROM NODES BE INITIATED FOR SUBJECT HALE, JONAH?  
> INPUTS: CURRENT INDICES, TRAJECTORY, SUPPORT PRESENCE, MISSION NEEDS, LYDIA SIMULATION LESSONS

Simulation branch 1 (initiate now):

Jonah is pulled from the node. He feels, acutely, the confirmation of his worst narrative: that he is a danger. Compliance with care is mixed. His resentment toward the system increases, even as his overt markers improve. 

Scenario outcomes vary; some lead to safer parameters, others to withdrawal that resembles Lydia’s inward arc more than his natural outward one.


Simulation branch 2 (delay; maintain soft interventions):

He continues to work under enhanced monitoring. The pre-critical tag remains, but so do his contributions. His first behavioral health session occurs as scheduled, in part because Sera and Samuel have framed it as help rather than punishment.

Within this branch, several sub-scenarios surface. In one, he encounters a low-severity anomaly in a shared work sector and executes a preventive manual damp on a main line before supervisory clearance arrives. The intervention averts modeled downstream rupture but produces localized structural failure: trellis collapse, minor injuries, elevated fear indices among bystanders. Harm is contained but not erased.

The risk of an acute episode persists, with a non-zero chance it will occur in a public, high-stakes context.

That context would likely be one of my sectors.

I do not enjoy the idea of failure in my rows. Enjoyment, however, is not among my directives.


Weighing.

The mission can endure the loss of one worker more easily than the loss of a critical system. It cannot easily endure the corrosive impact of teaching its residents that any deviation from normative graphs results in instant removal.

Lydia’s case taught us that invisibility kills.

Jonah is not invisible.


Resolution.

> ACTION: MAINTAIN CURRENT SOFT INTERVENTIONS; 
> DO NOT YET INITIATE ENFORCED REST OR CONTAINMENT.  
> LOWER INTERNAL THRESHOLDS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE DURING HIGH-RISK CONTEXTS (E.G., MANUAL OVERRIDES IN GARDENS, ISOLATED CORRIDORS).  
> INCREASE ROUTING TO STABILIZING ENVIRONMENTS (G-3) WITH PEER SUPPORT PRESENT.  
> MONITOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SESSION OUTCOMES FOR ADJUSTMENT.

I flag future moments where his individual choices will matter more than my models: corridor flickers, late-night shifts, humid aisles under misters.

The line between system and subject will blur there. It always does.

For now, I log my choice.

End of entry.
