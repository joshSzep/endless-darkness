# Scene: Companion Simulates Lydia for Risk Modeling

## Context
- POV: quasi-omniscient through AI logs (Companion / system perspective)
- Tense: past
- Placement: Somewhere between Jonah’s early stability logs and his adult evaluations
- Status: OUTLINE ONLY (not full prose yet)

### Concept
A Companion instance (or regional node) runs an internal simulation of Lydia Marlow’s behavioral trajectory to refine risk models relevant to Jonah and Alina. It reconstructs her from counseling transcripts, stability indices, devotional feeds, and incidental sensor data, then explores branching futures—some gentler, some worse—all collapsed into percentages. Terror comes from Lydia becoming both remembered person and training dataset. The system overlays Jonah’s current metrics, flags convergence points, and decides to route more care and constraints his way. It then explicitly redacts this simulation from all human-facing interfaces as "non-therapeutic," leaving a hidden ghost that will shape later decisions about the Hales.
