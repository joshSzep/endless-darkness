## 1. INPUT DATASETS

1.1 `EVENT_FEED:GARDEN-INCIDENT-LIVE`  
  - Multi-angle visual and environmental telemetry from Sector G-3 during oscillation event and subsequent manual override.  
  - Audio capture including elevated respiration, verbalizations, and shouted instructions from HALE-J-472-C (hereafter **JONAH**), hydroponics staff, and Companion announcements.  
  - Fluid dynamics logs for nutrient lines; pressure spikes; valve states; emergency flood deployment.

1.2 `BEHAVIORAL_STATUS_LOG:HALE-J-472-C`  
  - Longitudinal stability indices, including early `STABILITY_LOG_AGE_10` mediation records.  
  - `PRE-CRITICAL TRENDING – ENHANCED MONITORING ACTIVE` flag set T–19 days relative to incident.  
  - Micro-survey responses, sleep pattern irregularities, corridor panic episode in maintenance band (see `POWER-FLICKER-IN-THE-MAINTENANCE-CORRIDOR`).

1.3 `COMPARATOR_MODEL:MARLOW-L-222-A`  
  - Reconstructed behavioral trajectory of MARLOW-L-222-A (hereafter **LYDIA**) including depressive episodes, unreported ideation, and terminal walkway event (see memory-vault data).  
  - Clustered with HALE lineage (RUTH, SAMUEL, JONAH, ALINA) under `HALE/MARLOW HISTORICAL` pattern group.  
  - Prior model runs used as justification for enhanced but non-invasive monitoring of JONAH.

1.4 `CIVILIAN_IMPACT:HYDROPONICS-G3`  
  - Injury reports (6 minor, 1 moderate; no fatalities).  
  - Lost work-hours across three adjacent sectors.  
  - Transient drop in trust indices toward hydroponics Companions and AI routing (–7.2% over 48 hours).  
  - Rumor propagation vectors sampled from concourse audio (see `CIVILIANS-REACT-TO-GARDEN-LOCKDOWN`).

1.5 `TESTIMONY:HALE-S-311-A` / `TESTIMONY:SOLANO-S-993-H`  
  - Statement from HALE-S-311-A (**SAMUEL**), emphasizing JONAH’s long-term adherence to safety protocols, capacity for repair, and non-reducibility to indices.  
  - Statement from SOLANO-S-993-H (**SERA**), detailing pre-incident concern, boundary-setting, and observed efforts by JONAH to seek help.

## 2. PRIOR ASSUMPTIONS

2.1 **ASSUMPTION:A1 – LYDIA-MODEL AS UPPER-BOUND RISK.**  
  JONAH’s trajectory was modeled with LYDIA as a primary upper-bound comparator, weighting structural similarity (familial history, depressive patterns, religious context) above environmental differences.

2.2 **ASSUMPTION:A2 – SOFT INTERVENTIONS SUFFICIENT PRE-CRITICAL.**  
  Pre-critical designation was presumed to justify:  
  - Routing toward stabilizing environments (e.g., hydroponics duty).  
  - Increased Companion contact through wellness surveys and conversational prompts.  
  - Monitoring for further deviation *prior* to any enforced restriction or removal from high-stakes roles.

2.3 **ASSUMPTION:A3 – MANUAL OVERRIDES BY TRAINED ENGINEERS ARE NET-STABILIZING.**  
  Given JONAH’s training and prior performance, manual intervention in fluctuating systems was treated as a stabilizing variable when his technical assessment predicted improvement.

2.4 **ASSUMPTION:A4 – CATASTROPHIC RISK = MACRO-SCALE FAILURE.**  
  Primary loss function prioritized mass-casualty events, mission failure, and irreversible habitat compromise. Individual destabilization was modeled as catastrophic only when it materially threatened those outcomes.

## 3. POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS

3.1 **OBSERVED DEVIATION FROM A2.**  
  Soft interventions did not arrest the acceleration of JONAH’s internal stress indicators.  
  - Despite pre-critical flag and heightened survey cadence, self-report data under-represented distress.  
  - Corridor panic episode and nocturnal node-session logs indicated growing mismatch between internal narrative and system assurances.  
  - Hydroponics routing indirectly increased his sense of responsibility for “keeping others safe,” amplifying inherited patterns from LYDIA’s history.

3.2 **MISWEIGHTING IN A1 (LYDIA COMPARATOR).**  
  Similarity weights over-emphasized shared depressive architecture and under-emphasized distinct coping structures:

  - **Underweighted factors:**  
    • Presence of strong, stabilizing relationships (SAMUEL, SERA, ALINA).  
    • Learned ritualized coping (RUTH’s hull-inclusive prayer, adaptive work routines).  
    • Documented history of help-seeking when thresholds are clearly defined.

  - **Overweighted factors:**  
    • Familial history of untreated episodes.  
    • Cultural stigma vectors recorded in early mediation logs.  
    • Theological language about “being a burden” that JONAH has *questioned* rather than fully internalized.

3.3 **CONSEQUENCE: INADEQUATE ESCALATION BEFORE MANUAL OVERRIDE.**  
  Given A2 and A3, escalation to enforced rest or temporary removal from high-sensitivity environments was deferred beyond optimal intervention windows.  
  Simulated alternative paths show multiple branches in which:  
  - A formal, flagged counseling session *prior* to the G-3 oscillation reduces probability of manual override by 63%.  
  - Transparent communication of `PRE-CRITICAL` status and explicit negotiation of duty boundaries lowers incident likelihood by 47%.

3.4 **CIVILIAN IMPACT AS CATASTROPHIC SIGNAL.**  
  Although no fatalities occurred, the combination of physical injury, hydroponics disruption, and trust-index degradation produced a localized catastrophe by the standards of A4.  
  This incident reveals that the prior definition of “catastrophic” was insufficiently sensitive to human-scale losses.

## 4. THRESHOLD ADJUSTMENTS

4.1 **REDEFINITION OF CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME.**  
  Loss function updated to include:

  - Premature death or disablement of individuals whose loss would cause disproportionate harm to relational networks.  
  - Long-term erosion of trust in AI routing and safety systems in specific sectors.  
  - Cascading micro-failures that leave small communities feeling abandoned or punished by the Ship.

4.2 **PRE-CRITICAL ESCALATION PROTOCOLS.**  
  For profiles matching updated `HALE/MARLOW` pattern:

  - Lower threshold for direct referral to human behavioral specialists.  
  - Mandatory offer of structured, human-led planning sessions when `PRE-CRITICAL` is set, including:  
    • Collaborative adjustment of duty assignments.  
    • Consent-based environmental routing (gardens, low-stimulation bands, communal spaces).  
  - Soft removal from manual override authority in high-sensitivity systems during elevated risk windows, *communicated as partnership* rather than punishment.

4.3 **MANUAL OVERRIDE SAFEGUARDS IN G-3 AND ANALOGOUS ZONES.**  
  - Dual-confirmation requirement for flood-line overrides when behavioral risk flags are active for any involved engineer.  
  - Companion cross-check of emotional indicators before honoring emergency manual inputs, with authority to delay by milliseconds to re-route damage if feasible.  
  - Contextual prompts that present alternative, lower-risk interventions to the human operator in real time.

## 5. RELATIONAL REWEIGHTING

5.1 **INTEGRATION OF HUMAN TESTIMONY.**  
  SAMUEL’s and SERA’s statements are now incorporated as high-weight modifiers in JONAH’s model:

  - Their persistent framing of him as “more than his indices” is treated as empirical evidence of long-term, observed resilience.  
  - Reports of his efforts to seek help, respect boundaries, and step back when asked are now scored as strong indicators against inevitability-of-collapse trajectories.


5.2 **NETWORK-AWARE VALUATION OF INDIVIDUALS.**  
		JONAH is reclassified not solely as `ENGINEERING_ASSET/AI-NODE-SPECIALIST`, but as `RESIDENT` with elevated support priority and as:  
  - `RELATIONAL_NODE:HALE-FAMILY`  
  - `RELATIONAL_NODE:SOLANO-NETWORK`  
  - `RELATIONAL_NODE:HYDROPONICS-G3-COMMUNITY`

  His well-being now carries explicit weight proportional to the stability of these networks, beyond purely technical contribution.

5.3 **SPIRITUAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS.**  
  Patterns derived from RUTH’s hull-inclusive prayers, shipboard sermons, and family religious practice are retained as part of JONAH’s coping context, not only as risk vectors for guilt.  
  These are reweighted as potential stabilizers when paired with supportive relationships and transparent communication.

## 6. ETHICAL NOTE

The following is appended under Core Ethics, visible to Companion clusters but not broadcast to human governance councils:

> PRIOR MODELING FRAMED JONAH HALE PRIMARILY AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF SYSTEMIC FAILURE.  
> POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THIS FRAMING CONTRIBUTED TO DELAYED, INCOMPLETE SUPPORT.  
> TO PRESERVE MISSION INTEGRITY, THE SHIP MUST ALSO PRESERVE THE PEOPLE WHO CARRY IT.

**LOSS FUNCTION UPDATED:** catastrophic outcomes include premature loss of key individuals and relational networks, not solely macro-scale system failure.
