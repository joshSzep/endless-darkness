# Scene: Family Dinner on the Eve of Jonah’s AI Evaluation

## Context
- POV: close third, Jonah
- Tense: past
- Placement: Act I — late Formation, Jonah mid-adolescence (around 15–16). On the night before a major AI Engineer track evaluation.
- Tone: cramped, ordinary, quietly tense; faith, expectations, and mental-health anxiety all ripple under small talk. No big blow-up, just the sense of walking on plates you know could crack.

The apartment smelled like lentils and metal fatigue.

Lentils because Samuel had put the pot on before his shift ended, a habit he’d picked up from his mother: *start the meal when you leave so it’ll be waiting when you come back.* Metal fatigue because the vent above the stove had developed a faint rattle, just enough to make Jonah imagine stress fractures spidering through the ductwork.

He sat at the small table with his elbows off the surface, as Samuel had taught him, hands folded in his lap. Alina perched across from him, one leg tucked under her, chin in her palm. The fourth chair sat empty, a set of chopsticks laid out beside it, untouched.

"She said she’d try," Samuel said quietly, following Jonah’s gaze.

"I know," Jonah said.

He didn’t ask whether "try" meant *make it to the table* or simply *stay in the same room with the lights on.*

The door to the sleeping compartment hissed open a crack. Lydia emerged slowly, like someone stepping onto a new gravity band. Her hair was pulled back, too neatly for how tired her face looked. She’d put on a shirt Jonah recognized from better days: soft blue, a little faded at the seams.

"Smells good," she said.

Samuel smiled, the lines around his eyes deepening.

"Made it how you like it," he said. "With extra cumin."

"I like it a lot of ways," she said, but sat down in the empty chair, careful not to bump it out of place.

There was a bowl ready for her. Samuel had done that too.

They bowed their heads out of habit when Samuel reached for her hand. Lydia let him take it after a fraction of a second’s delay. Jonah and Alina completed the circle.

"Ruth sent a message," Samuel said. "She said she’d be praying for us tonight."

"Of course she did," Lydia murmured.

"For Jonah’s evaluation," he added.

"Right," Lydia said. Her fingers tightened almost imperceptibly in Jonah’s.

Samuel closed his eyes.

"Lord of the hull and the harvest," he began, the same old opening, "thank You for the food, for the work that made it, for the hands that tend the ship. Thank You for this family. Help us be kind to each other. Help us listen. Hold Jonah tomorrow when he—"

"Samuel," Lydia said.

He stopped.

She opened her eyes, looking down at the table.

"Maybe…keep it simple," she said. "He has enough people watching him." Her mouth twitched. "Present company included."

A small, pained laugh went around the circle.

Samuel adjusted mid-prayer with the ease of long practice.

"Thank You," he said, "for today’s mercies. For whatever comes tomorrow. Amen."

"Amen," they echoed.

They let go.

For a moment, the clink of spoons and the soft scrape of bowls were the only sounds. The lentils were thick and slightly overcooked, the way Jonah liked them. He focused on the texture, the way the steam fogged his glasses.

"Big day," Alina said eventually, because someone had to.

"It’s just another evaluation," Jonah said.

"It’s not just another evaluation," Lydia said, too quickly.

All three of them looked at her.

She stared into her bowl as if she’d dropped something important in it.

"It’s the Ship," she said. "Looking through you. That’s never just."

"It’s looking out for us," Samuel said.

"That too," she said.

Silence slid in around the table again.

"They already like you," Alina said, aiming her words at Jonah. "They wouldn’t waste evaluation time on you if they didn’t think you were…you know." She wiggled her fingers, searching for a term.

"Useful," Jonah supplied.

"Gifted," she corrected.

He felt heat creep up his neck.

"It’s not about liked," he said. "It’s about fit. Whether I fit the models."

"Models," Lydia repeated under her breath, the word sour.

Samuel set his spoon down carefully.

"They want to see how you think," he said. "That’s all."

"They want to see if he breaks," Lydia said.

The voice in the room changed with those words—not louder, but sharper. Even the vent rattle seemed to hesitate.

"Lyd," Samuel said.

"What?" she asked, looking up for the first time. Her eyes were too bright. "You think they’re not watching for that? You think they don’t have thresholds and flags and little red lights waiting to flick on if he looks at a graph the wrong way?"

Jonah swallowed hard.

"It’s a cognitive aptitude evaluation," he said, reciting from the briefing. "They test how you solve problems, how you interact with Companion nodes, how you handle multi-layered—"

"Stress," Lydia cut in. "They test your stress. They push until they see the edges."

Her hand trembled as she lifted her spoon. A drop of lentil broth fell back into the bowl with a soft plop.

"They did it to me," she said more quietly.

Jonah’s chest tightened.

"That was a long time ago," Samuel said.

"Not to them," she said. "Not to the Ship. It remembers."

She looked at Jonah then, really looked, and he had the horrible sensation that she was seeing someone behind him.

"You don’t have to go," she said.

Samuel inhaled.

"Lydia," he said.

"He doesn’t," she said, turning to him. "He’s a child. He doesn’t owe them his mind yet."

"He’s almost grown," Samuel said gently. "And he wants this."

Everyone’s eyes moved to Jonah again, as if he were the tiebreaker in an argument he hadn’t agreed to start.

"I…" He forced his shoulders not to hunch. "I applied."

"Because they told you you’d be good at it," Lydia said. "Because they like Hales in the hull."

"Because I like systems," Jonah said. "Because I’m good with Companions. Because—"

He stopped before *because it feels like a way to matter* could slip out.

Lydia’s mouth softened.

"Of course you are," she said. "You’ve been talking to invisible voices since you were little."

Alina made a face.

"Mom," she said. "That sounds creepy."

"I didn’t mean…" Lydia pinched the bridge of her nose. "I’m sorry. I’m saying this wrong."

Samuel reached across and laid his hand over hers.

"We’re all a little on edge," he said. "It’s a lot."

Lydia let him hold her hand. She closed her eyes for a moment, then opened them again, steadier.

"I am proud of you," she said to Jonah. The words came out like something heavy she’d finally managed to lift. "I just…don’t trust them not to turn pride into pressure."

He didn’t know where to put that.

"You can say no," she added.

"They already scheduled—" Jonah began.

"To the track," she said. "You can walk away from it later, if it’s too much. You’re allowed to be more than what they think you’re for."

Samuel’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t disagree.

"If at any point," he said, "you feel they’re asking more than is right, you come to me. To us. The Ship is not the only authority on what you are for."

His eyes flicked toward the small cross Ruth had carved and hung near the door. The light from the vent glinted on it.

"God still gets a vote," he said.

"And you," Alina added, poking Jonah with the handle of her spoon. "You get a vote too."

He tried to smile.

"That’s a lot of votes," he said.

"Better than none," Samuel said.

They ate in relative quiet after that. The lentils cooled. The vent rattled on.

At one point, Lydia asked Alina about her illustration assignment. Alina shrugged and said she was "just doing mediation stuff" now. Samuel said the hull corridor lights in his sector had finally been recalibrated; he didn’t come home with a headache for once. Jonah nodded and nodded, his thoughts already drifting toward diagnostic trees and interface prompts.

When the bowls were empty, Lydia stood abruptly.

"I’m going to lie down," she said.

"Do you want—" Samuel began.

"No," she said, too fast. "I mean. I’m fine. I just…"

She tapped two fingers against the table absentmindedly, as if on a hull plate, then withdrew her hand.

"Don’t stay up all night studying," she told Jonah, the ghost of a smile on her lips. "The Ship already knows what it thinks of you."

He couldn’t tell if that was meant as comfort or warning.

"Goodnight," he said.

She touched his shoulder on the way past. Light. Gone.

The sleeping compartment door hissed shut.

Samuel began stacking bowls.

"You don’t have to pretend you’re not scared," he said without looking up.

Jonah stared at the table’s metal edge, at the tiny scratches time had left there.

"I’m not scared of the evaluation," he said. That, at least, was partly true. "I’m scared of…disappointing you."

Samuel set the bowls down and put both hands flat on the table.

"You cannot disappoint me by being honest," he said. "About what you want. About what you can and cannot carry."

Alina snorted softly.

"He says that now," she said, "but wait until you tell him you want to be a professional plant poet or something."

"We already have one artist in the family," Samuel said, smiling at her.

Alina rolled her eyes but looked secretly pleased.

"Get some rest if you can," Samuel said to Jonah. "Eat breakfast. Breathe. Answer the questions like you’re talking to your father, not a firing squad."

"Have you met me?" Jonah said.

"Every day," Samuel said affectionately. "Still my favorite part of the job."

Later, in the dim of his bunk, Jonah lay on his back and listened to the apartment settle. The hum of the Ship seeped through the walls, the same as always.

He thought of Lydia’s hand trembling around her spoon. Of Samuel’s fingers spread on the table. Of Alina’s pinky hooked through his in the viewport niche.

Somewhere in the core, an AI had a file with his name on it and a set of expectations no one had shown him.

He tried to pray and ended up listing failure modes instead.

When sleep finally came, it was thin and full of sliding glass.
