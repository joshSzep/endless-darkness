Hydroponics smelled wrong for a place made of metal.

The corridor outside had the usual ship-scent: warmed alloy, recycled air, the faint soap of overused cleaners. But the moment Jonah stepped through the pressure door into Sector G-3, the air thickened. It met his face like a soft, damp cloth—humid, green, laced with faintly sour nutrient and something almost like soil.

His glasses fogged at the edges before the adaptive coating caught up.

"Welcome to hydroponics," the Companion at the entrance said, its voice a gentle murmur from a ceiling node. "Please mind the moisture gradients and watch your footing near open channels."

"Logged," Jonah said automatically.

He adjusted the strap on his tool bag and scanned his wrist display. The ticket that had routed him here blinked patiently: *Nutrient flow anomaly, row cluster 7B. Severity: Low. Technician: Hale, Jonah.*

Low severity. Simple fix. In theory.

Rows of greenery stretched away under grow-lights in long, careful lines: towers of leafy vines, waist-high troughs humming with circulation, trellises supporting something broad and dark and unfamiliar. The artificial day-cycle here was a softer spectrum than in the corridors, a warm wash that made the condensation on pipes look almost like morning.

Jonah had seen gardens before, on vids and quick walk-throughs. He had never been assigned to one. His work usually lived where metal met code, where the only green came from status indicators.

"You’re late," someone called from between the rows.

He turned, heart giving a small, stupid kick.

Sera Solano stepped out from behind a column of climbing plants, forearms wet to the elbow. Her coverall sleeves were rolled up and spattered with dark flecks; her hair was pulled back in a knot that had started neat and surrendered to humidity hours ago.

"Sorry," Jonah said. "Lift pause. And a misrouted cart." He realized, halfway through, that she had probably been joking.

Sera wiped her hands on a rag clipped to her belt and eyed him for a second, head tilted.

"Relax," she said. "The tomatoes aren’t going anywhere. Row 7B?"

"Yeah." He checked his display again, though he already knew. "Minor flow irregularity. Companion flagged it." 

"It flagged it," she echoed. "It’s been having opinions all morning. Come on."

She turned without waiting, weaving back into the rows. Jonah followed, careful not to brush against leaves that reached into the aisle like hands.

As they walked, the sounds of the gardens assembled themselves around him: the soft rush of water through channels, the whisper of air movers, the subtle creak of plant support frames settling under their own weight. People here moved more slowly than in the main corridors. A pair of workers farther down bent over a tray of seedlings, talking in low voices that dissolved into the general green hush.

"First time with us?" Sera asked over her shoulder.

"On assignment, yeah," Jonah said. "My father brought us once. When I was little. Different sector." He remembered being small and pressed up against the guard rail while Samuel pointed out how the rows curved with the ship’s hull. He hadn’t remembered the smell being this strong.

"You didn’t come back?" she asked.

"I live in corridors," he said, then immediately regretted how that sounded. "I mean—I work in—"

She laughed, quiet and real.

"I know what you mean," she said. "Don’t worry. The plants won’t take it personally."

They turned into a narrower aisle. At the far end, a line of indicator lights along a nutrient pipe blinked out of sync with their neighbors.

"Seven B," Sera said. "Your big moment."

Jonah exhaled slowly through his nose and crouched by the pipe. The panel lifted under his fingers, releasing a puff of warm, mineral scent. His wrist display synced with the local sensors, lines of numbers blooming into graphs.

"Companion," he said. "Show me flow history for seven bravo, last six hours."

A muted chime sounded from the nearby wall.

"Displaying," the local AI said. A small projection appeared on the underside of the open panel, lines of color tracking slight dips and rises.

Sera leaned her hip against the nearest support post, watching the plants instead of the graph.

"It’s been sulking since mid-shift," she said. "You tell me why."

He almost smiled. *Sulking.* It wasn’t how he thought about systems. They failed or they didn’t; they stayed in spec or they didn’t. But the word fit here in a way he couldn’t quite name.

He traced the graph with his fingertip, following the shallow valleys.

"Small lag in return flow," he said. "Nothing dramatic. But if it keeps drifting…"

"They start complaining," Sera finished, nodding toward the plants. "They like their consistency." 

He looked up involuntarily. The leaves along this row did look different—edges a little duller, stems angled not quite like their neighbors. He hadn’t noticed until she pointed.

"So," she said. "Is it a sensor lying, or a pipe grumbling?"

Jonah felt the familiar part of his brain kick in, the one that liked clean problems. "Valve assembly here," he said, tapping a section on the schematic. "If the servo’s slow, you’d see exactly this pattern. No alarms, but a mismatch between demand and response." 

"Can you fix it without making me shut down a whole row?" she asked.

"I can try," he said.

She made a small, approving sound and crouched beside him, close enough that he could feel the warmth radiating from her damp skin. She smelled like nutrient solution and something sharp and green underneath.

"Show me," she said.

He could feel his throat tighten the way it sometimes did in evaluations, when too many eyes were on him. He reminded himself there was only one person here, and she was already up to her elbows in the system he was supposedly here to help.

"If I reroute flow through the adjacent loop for five minutes," he said, fingers moving over the interface, "I can take the valve offline long enough to re-seat it and run a local test. No interruption to root feed longer than they’d notice." 

"‘They,’" Sera said. "You’re learning."

He risked a sideways glance. Her mouth was quirking, but her eyes were steady.

"I usually talk about systems like they’re just…systems," he said.

"They are," she said. "And they’re also the reason people don’t starve. And the reason some people have a place to go when they can’t stand another minute in metal corridors. Both things can be true." 

He thought of Alina, curled up on a bench with a sketch pad, drawing imaginary trees she’d never see. Of his mother staring past the kitchen wall. Of Samuel’s hand on the hull plates.

The valve assembly came free with a reluctant twist. He worked in silence for a minute, cleaning grit from the housing, reseating contacts, the small, precise tasks his hands trusted even when his head didn’t.

"You always narrate like that when you work?" Sera asked quietly.

He blinked. "Like what?"

"Like you’re giving a presentation to someone who might fail you," she said. "Every step justified, no room for doubt."

Heat rose under his collar.

"It’s just how I learned," he said. "In training. You explain everything or they assume you’re guessing."

"And out here?" She gestured with her chin toward the rows. "Who’s grading you? The lettuce?"

He huffed, more breath than laugh.

"Old habits," he said.

"Mm." She watched him for another moment, then moved to the next trough, fingers sliding into the nutrient solution to check flow over the roots. Her touch was efficient, practiced.

"For what it’s worth," she added, eyes on the plants, "you sound like you know what you’re doing. When you’re not trying to prove you’re allowed to breathe." 

The words landed in his chest with an unexpected weight. He tightened one last connection and reinstalled the valve.

"Companion," he said. "Bring seven bravo back online. Run local diagnostic."

"Re-engaging," the AI replied. Numbers ticked upward on his display, smoothing into a cleaner line. "Flow normalized. No further anomalies detected. Thank you, Jonah. Thank you, Sera."

"You’re welcome," Sera said automatically, then rolled her eyes toward the ceiling. "You see? Opinions."

"It’s not wrong," he said. "About the anomaly."

"I know," she said. "I just don’t like it thinking it runs everything."

There was no heat in it, only a mild wariness. Jonah recognized it, a distant cousin to his own fear.

"You don’t trust it?" he asked.

"I trust it to do exactly what it was built to do," she said. "Keep the ship alive. That’s not the same as keeping any of us comfortable. Or whole." 

She straightened and wiped her hands again, then looked at him fully.

"I trust people," she said. "Specific ones. When they earn it."

He didn’t know what to do with the way she said that, or the small, assessing pause that followed. He fell back on the safer topic.

"Flow’s stable now," he said. "You shouldn’t see any more sulking. If it drifts again, we can schedule a full replacement." 

"We," she repeated.

"Maintenance and hydroponics," he clarified quickly. "Not—"

"Relax," she said again, and this time there was a smile in it. "I like ‘we.’ Makes the place feel less lonely."

A worker down the row called Sera’s name. She lifted a hand in acknowledgment without taking her eyes off Jonah.

"You know you can come through here when you’re not on a ticket, right?" she said. "It’s not just for people who have official business."

"I don’t really…wander," he said.

"Figured," she said. "Still. The door opens for more than broken valves." 

He nodded, unsure if he’d ever take her up on it. The idea of walking into this humid, living space without a system to fix felt…indulgent. Exposed.

"Thanks for the assist," she said, stepping back. "You saved me a headache and the plants a bad day." 

"Just did my job," he said.

"Some people do their job and make more work for us later," she said. "You paid attention. That’s different."

He didn’t have an answer for that. She didn’t seem to need one.

"Next time," she added, already turning toward the next row, "if your route "just happens" to cut by the gardens again, I can show you the section where we keep the plants that don’t go into anyone’s lunch. The pretty ones." 

"There are pretty ones?" he asked, before he could stop himself.

She glanced back over her shoulder, eyes bright in the soft light.

"You’ll see," she said.

Then she was gone, lost between columns of green.

Jonah closed the panel and sealed it. The air felt thicker now, but not in a way that made it hard to breathe. The Companion at the entrance pinged an idle question at the edge of his interface—*Would you like to rate your experience in Sector G-3?*—and he dismissed it without answering.

On his way out, he hesitated by the pressure door.

He looked back once, down the long row where Sera moved, shoulders squared, hands steady, part of the rhythm of the place. The gardens seemed to watch him without accusation.

He stepped into the corridor’s thin, dry air and felt it close around him like a familiar, narrow coat.

For the first time in a long while, the thought came uninvited and almost gentle:

Maybe there was a place on the ship where his presence didn’t feel like a risk waiting to be tallied.

He filed the notion away with the ticket, under a label he didn’t yet have words for.
