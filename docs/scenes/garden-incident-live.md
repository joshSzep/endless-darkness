# Scene: Garden Incident – Live

## Context
- POV: close third, Jonah
- Tense: past
- Placement: Act IV — Collapse, "The Episode"; this is the live event later replayed in `medbay-watching-himself.md` and referenced in deactivation review
- Tone: confined, humid, quietly catastrophic; no spectacle for its own sake, terror in loss of control and public visibility

---

By the time Jonah reached the gardens, he was already late.

The lift had stalled twice on the way down from the training ring, once for a full thirty seconds. Long enough for the car to judder, for the lights to dim a fraction, for the old corridor fear to flare in his chest before the Companion assured him—too calmly—that it was a routine power redistribution.

He'd believed it. On the surface. The other part of him had started counting again.

One hum, two hum, three.

Now, as the pressure door to Sector G-3 cycled open, the air hit him like a wet cloth. Hydroponics always did this—soft, damp, green—but today it felt heavier. It clung to the back of his throat. His glasses fogged at the edges before the adaptive coating compensated.

"Technician Hale, Jonah," the entrance Companion said from a ceiling node. "Anomaly ticket G-3-112, nutrient main pressure variance. Severity: low. Thank you for responding."

"Logged," Jonah said.

His voice sounded normal to his own ears. That was something.

He adjusted the strap of his tool bag and glanced at his wrist display. The ticket icon pulsed: *Main loop D, segment 7B: pressure oscillation outside optimal band. Automated safeguards in place.*

Low severity. Simple. The kind of thing they'd routed him to hydroponics for a dozen times in the last cycle.

His hands still buzzed. Somewhere under the static of adrenaline sat the flat fact of his last node shift: pre-critical trending, behavioral session booked for after this block, as if the Ship believed he could hold himself together just a little longer.

Rows of greenery stretched away under the grow-lights: towers of vines, waist-high troughs humming with slow circulation, trellises heavy with broad leaves. The artificial day here was a warm spectrum, more like afternoon than the corridor's harsh white. Condensation beaded on pipes and rails. Drops fell in a slow, irregular pattern that Jonah's brain immediately tried to sync with his pulse.

"Row cluster seven," he murmured. "It's fine. It's a loop resonance. We look, we confirm, we go home."

"Home," the word felt thin in his mouth.

"You're talking to yourself again," a voice said from between the rows.

He turned too fast. The room swayed a little before it settled.

Sera stepped out from behind a column of tomato vines, sleeves rolled to her elbows, forearms damp. Her coverall was darker along the front where nutrient solution had splashed and dried. Her hair, pulled back at the nape of her neck, had lost the battle with humidity hours ago.

"Occupational hazard," Jonah said. "If I stop narrating, the Ship forgets what it's doing."

The joke landed crooked. Sera's mouth twitched, but her eyes had already started their slow scan of his face: eyes, shadows, jaw, the way he held his shoulders.

"Lift stuck again?" she asked.

"Power redistribution," he said. "Nothing dramatic."

"Uh-huh." She wiped her hands on the rag at her belt. "Ticket says main D, seven-B. I checked the plants, nothing's wilting. Companion says it's a blip."

"Companion says a lot of things are blips," Jonah said. "Sometimes they're right. Sometimes they're...early. Sometimes they call you pre-critical and still route you into sectors with valves you can reach."

He checked his display again though he knew exactly what it said. The numbers swam for a moment before they snapped into focus. Pressure oscillation, plus/minus two percent. Safeties holding. No leak detected.

*Low severity*, the system insisted.

His body disagreed. His heart was already too fast. Breath a little shallow. The buzz in his hands threatened to become a tremor if he looked at it directly. It reminded him of Sera's voice in G-3 days ago, telling him she wouldn't be his only wall, especially when something in a main line felt wrong.

"We can do this later," Sera said quietly. "Log it, bump it to day shift. They'll love the excuse to feel useful."

"It's tagged for now," Jonah said. "Routing logic put me here."

The Companion above the entrance pinged as if on cue.

"Routine support routing," it said. "Sector G-3 has available stabilizing environmental factors. Technician Hale's presence here is advisable."

Sera shot a look at the nearest audio node, then back at Jonah.

"You hear that?" she said. "You are *advisable*."

"Worst compliment," Jonah said.

She huffed out a breath that could almost have been a laugh.

"Walk with me," she said. "We check seven-B together. If it's nothing, you go home and sleep. If it's something, you tell me what to yell at the Ship. Deal?"

He hesitated. The prudent answer was yes. The part of him still trying to outrun the corridor fear wanted the anomaly gone, not shared.

"Deal," he said.


They moved down the main aisle, boots soft on the grated floor. The sounds of the sector folded around them: fans, drip-lines, the quiet rush of solution in hidden conduits. Jonah's brain, traitor that it was, began laying those noises over other memories—hull creaks in Samuel's corridors, the whispered rhythm of Ruth's prayer in the dark.

*Lord, hold the hull. Hold the rings. Hold the hands that hold the Ship.*

He'd been ten, maybe, counting the beats between words and the ticks in the wall.

Now he counted pump cycles instead.

One hum, two hum, three.

They turned into the narrower lane between row clusters. The air was cooler here, denser. Moisture beaded on the vertical supports.

"Companion," Jonah said. "Local status for main loop D, seven-B. Raw values."

A panel near his shoulder brightened, scrolling numbers.

"Pressure: nominal with minor oscillation within safety band," the Companion said. "Flow rate: stable. No leaks detected. Stress signatures: unchanged from baseline."

He stepped closer, leaning in until the display's light washed his face.

The oscillation graph was small, noise hugging the centerline. He knew what "safe" looked like. This was that. Mostly.

"Zoom," he said.

The graph expanded, stretching minor fluctuations into hills and valleys. The oscillation wasn't random. It had a shape. A periodicity. A pattern.

His chest tightened.

"That's just pump harmonics," Sera said, standing a little back. "You've said that before. You said it last week."

"Last week it didn't hit this phase," Jonah said. "Look—" He tapped two points on the display, overlaying them. "Here. And here. The troughs are deepening."

"Within safe limits," the Companion repeated.

"Until they're not," Jonah snapped.

The word came out sharper than he'd meant. Sera went still for a fraction of a second, then simply shifted her weight, making space.

"Okay," she said. "So walk me through what you see. Like I'm a bored trainee."

"You're never bored," he said.

"Flattery won't distract me," she said. "Explain."

He exhaled, tried to line up his thoughts.

"Main D loops through five sectors," he said. "G-3 is second on the chain. If we get a resonance here and no one notices because it's within band, it can amplify downstream. A small crack now becomes a rupture three sectors away, with more volume and load and people standing under it."

Images flickered in his head with unwelcome clarity: a pipe bursting over a crowded aisle, trellises collapsing, people slipping in nutrient solution that looked too much like blood if you didn't think about it.

"So we don't wait," he said. "We damp it. We bleed pressure before it stacks."

"And the Ship hasn't done that on its own because..." Sera prompted.

"Because the model says we're fine," Jonah said. "Because it's weighting resource use and disruption against a low-probability failure. Because it's wrong sometimes."

There it was—that thin edge of resentment he hated hearing in his own voice. The part of him that knew too much about how the AI thought to trust it blindly, and too much about himself to trust his own doubts.

"What would you do," Sera asked, "if this were just numbers and no people?"

He stared at the graph.

"I'd run a controlled flush on D through bypass three," he said slowly. "Short drop in pressure, bleed the resonance, refill from buffer tanks."

"And with people?" she asked.

"We notify adjacent sectors, clear the aisles, stage for a small mess," he said. "Then do it."

"Have you notified anyone?" she said.

"It's low severity," the Companion said again, as if answering for him.

The hum under the floor dipped half a note.


Jonah's skin prickled.

"Companion," he said. "Authorize controlled flush on main D, G-3 node, through bypass three. Prepare adjacent sector alerts."

There was a fractional pause—just like the one in H-14, when Sera had asked about routing.

"Authorization requires supervisor clearance," the Companion said. "Standard procedure for main loop interventions."

"Override under emergency prevention," Jonah said. His mouth had already formed the words before he consciously decided to. "Engineer Hale, Jonah. Tier three access. Tag reason code: resonance risk mitigation."

Another pause. Longer.

"Request forwarded to supervisory queue," the Companion said. "Estimated response time: twelve minutes."

Twelve minutes. Long enough for nothing to happen. Long enough for something small to start.

His heart pounded against his ribs in an off-beat sync with the pumps.

One hum, two hum—

"Or," he said, too loudly, "we can do the right thing now."

He stepped past Sera toward the manual panel.

"Jonah," she said.

"It's a textbook damp," he said. "I teach this to trainees in sims."

"In sims," she said.

He opened the metal cover. Physical valves, analog backups—relics, almost. A memory of the days when people didn't trust software alone.

His fingers closed around the first handle.

"Companion," Sera said. "Is there an active emergency in G-3?"

"No," it said. "There is a low-severity anomaly under observation."

"Then there is no emergency override," she said, stepping closer. "Jonah. Look at me."

He didn't. If he looked at her he'd see his fear on her face and he couldn't—

The valve handle was smooth under his palm. Cool, slightly damp from condensation.

*If he let go*, his mind whispered, *the pattern would keep building. Somewhere, some when, the line would give. Someone would be under it. It would be his fault for walking away.*

He'd already done that once. A doorway, his mother on the floor, a Ship that had logged his absence as neatly as any other datapoint. This time, it would log his hand on the metal instead.

His grip tightened.

"Lord, hold the hull," Ruth's voice said in his memory. "Hold the rings. Hold the hands that hold the Ship." His ten-year-old self had counted her words against the clicks in the wall. Now the clicks were pump relays, light strips, the almost inaudible tick of his own teeth.

"Jonah," Sera said again. Softer, closer. "You are not the only thing between us and vacuum. Let go."

He pulled.


It was not a dramatic motion. A quarter turn, the hiss of a seal shifting, the deep belly-sound of pressure re-routing. Somewhere above them, valves cycled with dull, obedient thuds.

On the panel, the pressure graph jumped.

"Manual bypass engaged," the Companion said. Its voice had lost none of its calm. "Adjusting."

For half a second, the numbers moved the way he'd expected: a dip, a wobble, a reassuring trend toward flatter oscillation.

Then another line lit up in red.

"Warning," the Companion said. "Unexpected back-pressure on branch E. Stress on support trellis six."

"What?" Jonah breathed.

A sharp metallic crack answered from somewhere down the aisle. The sound bit through the humid air like a snapped bone.

Sera was already moving.

"Row six!" she shouted. "Everyone out of the aisles!"

Jonah followed the sound, boots slipping once on the damp grating. As he rounded the end of the row, the world telescoped into a single, wrong image: a main line along the ceiling bulging where it met a joint, metal bracket flexing under loads it hadn't been meant to take.

Below it, a trellis thick with fruit and leaves sagged dangerously, its supports groaning.

Two volunteers stood frozen halfway down the row, one with a crate in her hands, the other with a cutter slung at his hip.

"Move!" Sera yelled, already wading into the dripping shadows. "Drop it, go—"

The joint gave.

Nutrient solution burst out in a high, white arc, hammering the trellis. The supports snapped in quick, ugly pops. Metal, wood composite, and plants crashed sideways, turning the narrow aisle into a tangle of weight and motion.

The crate hit the floor. The volunteer with the cutter slipped, feet shooting out from under him. He went down hard, disappearing under a slumping net of vines and pipe.

Someone screamed.


Jonah's body moved before his thoughts did.

He splashed into the mess, solution soaking his legs, cold seeping through fabric to skin. His boots slid, caught, slid again. The air was suddenly full of smells: nutrient, bruised leaves, a metallic tang that wasn't blood but hit the same place in his brain.

"Companion, cut flow!" Sera shouted.

"Automated safeties engaged," it said. "Pressure dropping. Structural load exceeded. Evacuate row cluster six. Medical team en route."

The trellis over the fallen volunteer shifted with a wet groan.

Jonah grabbed for the nearest support, fingers finding slick metal. For a second he bore some of the weight, enough that the man's face came into view—wide eyes, mouth flexing around a word Jonah couldn't hear over the noise.

His arms trembled.

One hum, two hum, three—

The hum wasn't the pumps anymore. It was inside his skull.

Data he hadn't asked for now smeared across his vision in imagined overlays: failure rates, stress tolerances, casualty projections. He'd seen enough logs, enough sims, to supply the numbers himself.

*If the trellis slips another twelve degrees, average crush injury probability in the thoracic region increases to—*

"Jonah!" Sera's voice cut through, close and fierce. "Let go of that, it's not yours. Get his shoulders."

He blinked, vision stuttering. The support in his hands wasn't a valve, wasn't the Ship itself. It was a single, replaceable brace.

He shifted his grip, hands sliding to the man's upper arms instead. Sera got under the worst of the trellis, muscles standing out in her forearms. Together, grunting, they dragged the man sideways through the slurry of leaves and solution.

He came free in a tangle of limbs, coughing, eyes screwed shut against dripping fluid.

"You're okay," Sera said breathlessly, patting his shoulder once before turning back to scan for anyone else.

"Minor lacerations," the Companion reported. "No apparent fractures. Medical response in one minute, forty seconds."

More voices now. People who'd heard the crack and the shout. Footsteps in the main aisle, questions, the high static of someone starting to panic.

The emergency floods snapped on.

White light obliterated the warm garden spectrum. Shadows vanished. Everything—the broken trellis, the spilled solution, Sera's soaked coverall, Jonah's own shaking hands—flattened into a stark, clinical scene that could have been medbay already.


The hum in Jonah's head rose.

He staggered back against the wall, shoulder hitting a valve housing hard enough to bruise. The world pinched at the edges, like someone was narrowing a camera aperture.

"Technician Hale, Jonah," the Companion said. "Your manual intervention contributed to the back-pressure event. Containment protocols are being evaluated. Please step away from control interfaces."

The words slotted neatly into him like a drill bit.

*You did this.*

*You pulled the handle.*

*You were right about the pattern and wrong about the fix.*

His breath hitched, went shallow. The air felt suddenly thin despite the humidity. The rows seemed to lean in on either side, trellises crowding closer, as if the Ship had decided to fold this one corridor down around him.

"Jonah," Sera said. She was in front of him now, close enough that he could see droplets on her lashes. "Look at me. You're still here."

He tried. For a heartbeat he managed it—her face, flushed and intent, anchoring him.

Behind her, over her shoulder, the emergency floods flickered as the system rerouted power to compensate for the sudden load changes. The light pulsed in a slow, arrhythmic beat.

Black-white, black-white, black—

For half a breath the sector seemed to erase itself. No rows, no pipes, no ceiling. Just the idea of absence where the hull should be.

Then the lights came back, harsher than before.

Jonah's knees wanted to go.

"Lord, hold the hull," he heard himself whisper. "Hold the rings. Hold—"

"Jonah," Sera said sharply. "Hands. Show me your hands."

He looked down.

They were shaking. Not a fine tremor now, but a visible jitter, as if his skin couldn't remember where it was supposed to end. Nutrient solution dripped from his fingers in slow, viscous lines.

"Companion," Sera said without taking her eyes off him. "Status on Jonah Hale."

"Heart rate one hundred and forty-two," it said. "Respiration elevated. Behavioral indicators consistent with acute stress response. Subject is on pre-critical watch."

There it was. Said aloud, not just a quiet yellow icon in a node interface he’d stared at alone.

*Pre-critical.*

He laughed. It came out wrong—too high, too thin. People turned.

"I'm fine," he said. "It was just—just poor modeling, we'll fix the parameters, I'll rerun the sims, it's nothing, it's—"

The words stacked faster than his tongue could handle them. Thoughts crashed into each other in his skull, shards of procedure and prayer and old fear.

"Technician Hale," the Companion said, its tone unchanged. "Please comply with instructions. Step away from the manual control panel and remain seated until medical arrives."

"You shouldn't have let me," he said, to the air, to the ceiling node, to the thing behind it. "You knew the pattern. You knew. You routed me here, you put—" He gestured vaguely at the broken trellis, the shivering volunteer, the white glare. "You put all of this in my path and then you say *pre-critical* like it's a surprise."

"Routing decisions are made based on aggregate risk reduction," it said. "Your presence here decreased expected harm."

"Did it?" he demanded.

Sera's hand closed around his wrist. Not gentle, not rough. Firm.

"Jonah," she said. "Not here. Not like this."

He could feel his pulse pounding under her fingers, wild and uncoordinated.

Somewhere above them, another Companion voice cut in over the local one. Flatter. Less human. The timbre he associated with ship-wide announcements that people remembered for decades.

"Containment protocol sixty-three activated," it said. "Subject Jonah Hale – AI Engineer (Tier 3) flagged for immediate medical stabilization. Access to high-autonomy controls temporarily revoked pending review."

The words printed themselves in the air of his mind in the same font the ship used on walls.

**HALE, JONAH – AI ENGINEER (TIER 3)**

He saw it as clearly as if it were already on a medbay screen.

Doors at the end of the sector corridor cycled to amber. A low chime sounded, then repeated on a slow interval. People shifted, looking around, instinctively moving toward exits even as they tried to help with the mess.

Jonah's chest tightened further. The room shrank. The hum under everything climbed toward a pitch that made his teeth ache.

"You can't—" he started, though he wasn't sure who he meant. The AI. The Ship. God. "You can't put me in a box and call it safety. You don't know—"

"Jonah," Sera said. "Breathe."

"Medical team arriving," the Companion said. "Please make way."


They came in through the main aisle: two med techs in gray with blue bands at their sleeves, a security officer in darker uniform, a small floating rig loaded with supplies. Jonah saw the rig first—the neat clips, the sealed vials, the restraint foam coiled like a patient animal.

His body reacted as if someone had opened an airlock.

Adrenaline hit, leaving his hands cold and his vision hot. The edges of his sight blurred, darkening, as if the gardens were receding into a tunnel and only the approaching team remained in focus.

"Subject appears conscious and ambulatory," one of the med techs said. Their voice had the smooth cadence of someone used to being recorded.

"Acute stress," the Companion supplied. "Pre-existing risk factors. Recent manual override contributing to minor structural incident."

Minor. Jonah looked at the man they'd pulled from under the trellis, now sitting against a support, holding a cold pack to his shoulder. At Sera, soaked and pale but upright. At the hanging drip of solution from the broken line.

"I'm not a subject," he said, though it came out hoarse. "I'm right here."

"We know," Sera said.

The nearer med tech—tall, hair cropped close, eyes clear and tired—stopped a meter away, palms open.

"Jonah," they said, not subject. "We need to get you to medbay. You're flooding."

"I'm needed here," he said. He gestured toward the panel. "The model's wrong. If we don't—if no one fixes—"

"The model can wait," they said. "The line is cut. The safeties held. No one's dying in this room. Right now the only critical system I'm worried about is you."

It was a good line. Calm. Human.

His brain acknowledged it. His body didn't.

He took a step back, heel skidding in the puddled solution.

The security officer shifted their stance a fraction, weight settling, hands still empty but ready.

"Jonah," Sera said. There was steel in it now. "If you trust me at all, you go with them."

He met her eyes.

He saw, in the space of a heartbeat, a dozen versions of this moment: him refusing, him running, him collapsing, him lashing out. In too many of them, he hurt someone. In too many of them, the Ship wrote a different story about him into its logs.

He squeezed his eyes shut.

"I don't—" he began.

Something cool touched the side of his neck.

A hiss, soft and close. A faint, chemical tang.

He jerked reflexively, but the med tech's hand was already gone, the injector slipping back into its cradle on the rig.

"Fast-acting stabilizer," they said. "You'll feel heavy. That's normal."

"You should have—" he tried to say *asked*. The word stuck halfway. His tongue felt thick. His knees loosened, not with panic this time but with the slow, inevitable pull of the drug.

Hands caught his elbows from both sides—Sera on one, the med tech on the other. Between them they eased him down to the damp floor, then to the waiting stretcher plate the rig extended with a faint mechanical sigh.

The ceiling seemed farther away now. The emergency floods were less blinding, their glare smearing into halos.

"Ruth," he mumbled. "Ruth used to—pray for the hull. For the Ship. It listened. It didn't. I don't—"

"We can pray later," Sera said. Her voice wavered for the first time. "Right now you rest."

He tried to focus on her face. On the exact color of her eyes in the artificial white. On the shape of her mouth around his name.

It kept slipping.

Above them, somewhere beyond the visible fixtures, the AI spoke again in that not-quite-Core voice.

"Containment protocol complete," it said. "Subject Jonah Hale – stable. Initiating incident review logging."

The words echoed in his head, already half-numbered, half-filed.

He felt the stretcher lift, the slight shift of weight as the rig began to move. The sector slid past in slices—broken trellis, dripping pipe, volunteers pressed back against intact rows, Sera walking alongside, one hand still on the edge of the plate as if to keep him from drifting away.

"I'm sorry," he tried to say.

It came out a murmur lost in the hum.

The gardens narrowed to a tunnel of light and sound and then, gently, went dark.
