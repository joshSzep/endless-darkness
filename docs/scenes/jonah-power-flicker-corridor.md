# Scene: Jonah in the Corridor During a Power Flicker

## Context
- Point of view: close third, Jonah
- Tense: past
- Placement: Early–mid Act II, after readers already know Jonah fears his own mind.
- Intensity: Quiet but suffocating; a small external event triggers a disproportionate internal terror response.

The corridor should have felt ordinary.

Third shift was almost over, and most of the maintenance crew had already peeled off toward the lifts, their boots a fading rhythm on the metal grating. Jonah lingered to finish the last diagnostic on a regional Companion node, palms still buzzing from where he had been braced against the panel. The hatch behind him sealed with a soft thump. Ahead, the long spine of the access way stretched away in careful, measured rectangles of light.

He told himself he liked these walks. That was the story, anyway. Quiet time. No crowds. Just the hum of the ship and the simple, clean geometry of the corridor.

He took three steps before the lights went out.

Not all the way. Not yet. They cut from day-cycle white to emergency red, a single blink that smeared the metal into shadow and color. The floor under his boots vibrated—one sharp shudder, then stillness. The hum of the air processors dipped a note lower, then recovered.

Jonah froze.

This is nothing, he thought. A power reroute. A local test. They said they were testing.

The thought sounded like someone else’s voice, a line read from a safety briefing. It did not reach the back of his skull, the deep place where fear lived. There, another sentence unfurled in a slow, cold script: This is the start.

His heart kicked so hard it felt like it might bruise his ribs. The red strips along the ceiling pulsed, timed to some unseen system heartbeat. Between each pulse the corridor seemed to erase itself. For half a breath there was just black—no walls, no floor, no ship—only the weight of the hull and the idea of nothing beyond it.

Breath, he told himself. In, out. Count it.

His lungs had already decided otherwise. Air came in quick, shallow bites. His fingers had curled so tight around the strap of his tool bag that his knuckles hurt.

“Companion,” he said, or tried to. The word came out smaller than he wanted. “Status?”

The nearest wall node glowed a soft amber in answer, a halo of sane, ordinary light.

“Local power reroute in progress,” the AI said. Its voice was calm and clear, the same tone it used for shift reminders and meal suggestions. “No danger to hull integrity or life support. Estimated duration: eighty-three seconds.”

Eighty-three seconds. Less than two minutes. He could do two minutes. He had done worse.

His body did not care. Sweat prickled along his spine, cold despite the artificial warmth of the air. The metal under his boots felt thinner than it had an hour ago, as if the ship had stretched itself too far and left only a skin between him and the dark.

He could see it—his mind obligingly gave him the picture he hated. The corridor falling away, the ship cracking open along a line of unseen weakness, the pressure dropping in a rush that snatched every sound out of the air. No up, no down, just a long, soundless fall into nothing. The image pressed against the inside of his eyes until the red lights blurred.

"Jonah," the Companion said. It did not sound surprised to know his name; AI Engineer trainees were tagged closely in this sector. "Your heart rate is elevated. Do you require assistance?"

He wanted to say no. He always wanted to say no. No kept him useful. No kept him from the med decks, from evaluations and forms and looks that said we are concerned about you in a way that meant we are concerned about our systems.

His pulse thudded in his ears, too loud. The memory rose, uninvited: his mother’s hand slamming against the bulkhead when he was small, her breath coming in sharp, panicked bursts like his own now. The way she had whispered I can’t do this, I can’t do this into the metal as if the ship were listening.

What if this is that, he thought. What if this is where it starts for me.

He grabbed the railing that ran waist-high along the corridor wall. The grip was smooth from generations of hands. He clung to it until the shaking in his arms matched the faint vibration of the deck.

"I'm fine," he lied.

The AI did not argue. "I will remain connected," it said instead. "Seventy seconds remaining."

Each pulse of red light marked out time in slow, viscous beats. Jonah tried to match his breathing to them. In on the glow, out in the dark. The counting helped, a little. He could feel the edge, the thin tipping point between this—this tight, nauseating fear—and the larger thing he dreaded, the storm he imagined would one day pull him completely under.

If the lights stay off, he thought, something in me will break.

"Fifty-four seconds," the Companion said softly.

He squeezed his eyes shut, which was worse, because then the dark was not the corridor’s but his own. He opened them again to prove the world was still there. Metal. Bolts. The faint scuff of his own boots on the floor where he had shifted his weight. The amber ring of the wall node.

"Tell me a story," he said before he could stop himself.

There was a pause long enough for him to think he had made a mistake. Then the AI said, "What kind of story would you like, Jonah?"

He almost laughed. The sound caught in his throat.

"One where the ship doesn’t break," he said. "Just—talk."

Another tiny pause, like a breath drawn by something that did not need to breathe.

"When the ship was three thousand years into its journey," the Companion began, "a segment of the outer hull experienced stress fracturing due to an unplanned micro-meteor impact. Maintenance teams responded within twenty-two minutes. No lives were lost. The damaged section was reinforced beyond its original specification. The probability of failure in that region is now lower than in any comparable section of the hull."

Jonah stared at the red glow while it spoke. The story was not comforting in the way he had meant, but it was concrete. Numbers. Actions. Outcomes.

"You could have made something up," he muttered.

"I chose a true story," the AI said. "Thirty-one seconds remaining."

His grip on the railing eased by a fraction. The worst of the pressure in his chest shifted into a tight, exhausted ache. He counted the last half-minute with the Companion’s updates, measuring each second against the unbroken feel of the deck beneath his boots.

When the lights came back—white and flat and almost ugly—they made him blink. The corridor shrank back into its ordinary dimensions. The hum of the air processors rose half a note.

"Local power reroute complete," the AI said. "All systems nominal."

Jonah did not move for a few breaths. His hands left damp prints on the railing when he finally let go.

"You remained upright," the Companion observed. "You maintained motor control and situational awareness throughout the event."

"Low bar," he said. His voice sounded raw.

"Sometimes," the AI replied, "a low bar is still a bar."

He should have walked away then, caught up with the others, folded this moment into the long list of things he did not mention to anyone. Instead he stood in the too-bright corridor, feeling his pulse slowly climb down from its frantic peak, and let himself admit—for exactly one breath—that he had been afraid of more than the lights.

He had been afraid of himself.

Then he picked up his tool bag and started toward the lift, counting his steps like they were the only solid things in the world.
