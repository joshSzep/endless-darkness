### Concept
Jonah is summoned to a small committee room for a rare "Deactivation Risk Review"—a process that could remove him from all mission-critical access without harming him physically. A Companion and human reviewers speak in probabilistic, abstract risk language, referencing anonymized cases eerily similar to Lydia and to him. Samuel and Sera’s statements appear in his dossier as stabilizing factors. The terror comes from seeing his life turned into a set of variables the ship might decide are too costly to keep near the controls.
