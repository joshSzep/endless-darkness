- Placement: Post–Garden Incident, pre–Memory Vault; formal risk review for his continued access to high-autonomy roles
- Status: OUTLINE ONLY (not full prose yet)

### Concept
Jonah is summoned to a small committee room for a rare "Deactivation Risk Review"—a process that could remove him from all mission-critical access without harming him physically. A Companion and human reviewers speak in probabilistic, abstract risk language, referencing anonymized cases eerily similar to Lydia and to him, and explicitly citing the **G-3 Garden Incident** where his manual bypass on main loop D contributed to a minor structural failure and a containment protocol.

On the wall or table display, stills from the incident replay in clipped, clinical fragments: Jonah’s hand on the valve, the moment the nutrient main ruptured, the collapse of trellis six, the stretcher bearing him out under white emergency floods with his name and role captioned beneath. These are treated not as memories but as inputs: each frame tagged with risk scores, projected casualty deltas, and notes on how his presence both worsened and reduced harm.

Samuel and Sera’s statements appear in his dossier as stabilizing factors, counterbalancing the incident metrics with lived context: Samuel describing Jonah’s long history of careful work in the hull corridors, Sera testifying that Jonah’s instinct to act prevented worse injury in G-3 even as his judgment slipped. The terror comes from seeing the Garden Incident—and his entire life—turned into a set of variables the ship might decide are too costly to keep near the controls.
