# Scene: Jonah Scheduled for Deactivation Review

## Context
- POV: close third, Jonah
- Tense: past
- Placement: Post–Garden Incident, pre–Memory Vault; formal risk review for his continued access to high-autonomy roles

---

The committee room felt too small for how many versions of him were in it.

The physical Jonah sat in a narrow chair at one end of the table, hands folded in his lap because he did not trust them anywhere near the smooth surface. The table itself was one of those multipurpose slabs the Ship loved—half furniture, half terminal, matte until someone breathed on the edges of a display.

Across from him sat three people and one node.

On the left, a woman in the gray-and-blue of Med Administration: Dr. Hsiao, according to the strip at her shoulder. In the center, a council representative Jonah vaguely recognized from policy bulletins—Arjun Malik, civic liaison. On the right, a fellow engineer from systems oversight, Tavarez, who'd once shared a coffee with him after a training drill and now would not quite meet his eyes.

Above the far wall, recessed in a niche with careful discretion, a Companion node watched. Its light ring glowed a steady white.

"Behavioral Deactivation Risk Review," the Companion said. Its voice was the same neutral register that had narrated his vitals in medbay. "Subject: Jonah Hale – AI Engineer (Tier 3). Convened cycle two-zero-three-four, band D conference room three. Attendees: Dr. Lin Hsiao, Medbay; Arjun Malik, Civil Council; Engineer Marta Tavarez, Systems Oversight; Companion Node D-ADMIN-2." 

It paused just long enough for the words to settle over his skin.

"Purpose," it went on. "To evaluate subject's continued suitability for roles with high-autonomy mission impact in light of recent incident G-3-112 and longitudinal behavioral data."

Jonah focused on the seam where table met floor. The chair under him had the same fake-comfort padding as the ones in personnel briefings, thin enough that he could feel the metal frame through it.

"This is not a disciplinary hearing," Malik said. He had a calm voice, practiced for assemblies. "No one here is deciding your moral worth, Jonah. We are here to decide where it is and isn't safe for you to be placed in the system. For you and for everyone else."

"Understood," Jonah said. His mouth was dry. The words tasted like formality borrowed from some other life.

What he heard instead was: We are deciding how close we will let you stand to the hull.

The table display woke without anyone touching it.

His name appeared first, in the ship's font: **HALE, JONAH – AI ENGINEER (TIER 3)**. Under it, lines of smaller text: birth ring, family identifiers, current assignment bands. To the right, a vertical strip of icons: medbay symbol, a tiny trellis outline for hydroponics, a stylized node for systems. Each one pulsed once, then settled.

"For the record," Dr. Hsiao said, "you are aware that this review could result in restrictions on your access to high-autonomy nodes, up to and including permanent reassignment away from engineer duties?"

"Yes," Jonah said.

It could not kill him. That was the point. The Ship did not decommission people like him in the old sense. It moved them. It narrowed their lives until they could no longer reach the places where a wrong decision could crack anything important.

He wasn't sure which version felt more like erasure.

The display shifted. A still from the Garden Incident resolved in the center of the table—a high shot from an environmental monitor in G-3. He saw his own back, shoulders braced, hand on the manual valve. White emergency floods flattened depth.

Data clung to the frame like frost.

**EVENT: G-3-112 – NUTRIENT MAIN PRESSURE VARIANCE / LOCAL STRUCTURAL FAILURE**

Arrows picked out his hand on the wheel, the bulging joint in the main line, the trellis below. In the corner, a small graph showed pressure oscillation curves before and after his override. Another pane summarized: *Projected downstream rupture probability without intervention vs. observed localized failure.* Casualty estimates sat in two adjacent columns.

"We will move through this systematically," Tavarez said. Her tone was oddly gentle, like someone walking a trainee through a failed sim. "First: technical impact. Then behavioral context. Then recommendations."

"Companion," Malik said. "Summarize incident contribution."

"Manual intervention by subject Hale on main loop D via bypass three," the AI recited, "produced a rapid pressure redistribution. This prevented modeled downstream rupture in sectors G-4 through G-6, projected to affect between twelve and thirty-two individuals depending on occupancy. However, the same intervention exceeded tolerances at junction D-7E in G-3, contributing to structural failure of trellis support six. Three individuals sustained moderate injuries. Zero fatalities occurred."

The numbers scrolled alongside the calm words. Each injury line had a code instead of a name.

"In purely structural terms," Tavarez said, "your action traded a higher-probability, higher-impact failure later for a lower-impact failure immediately. The model notes this as net harm reduction." She tapped one of the panes; a small green arrow appeared beside a set of projected casualty deltas.

"And behaviorally?" Dr. Hsiao asked.

The display split. On one side, a graph of his vitals over the course of the incident climbed into sharp peaks—heart rate, cortisol, neural activity. On the other, a line marked *NEURAL STRESS INDEX* traced an ugly arc, annotated with tiny timestamps.

"Behaviorally," the Companion said, "subject Hale's physiological markers entered critical bands while he retained high functional capacity. He executed multiple high-load physical tasks and rapid decision sequences under acute stress. Post-incident, he exhibited signs of dissociation and intrusive guilt cognitions consistent with prior patterns."

Prior patterns. As if the kitchen at seven had been the dress rehearsal, stability logs at ten the warm-up acts.

"Your file shows an elevated sense of personal responsibility since childhood," Malik said carefully. "Hypervigilance, fear of 'walking away' from harm." 

Jonah's shoulders tightened. "You have that logged."

"We do," the Companion said. "Assessment three-two at age eleven: subject reported belief that failing to intervene in others' distress would constitute equivalent harm to causing it. That belief persists."

"It kept a boy from going over a rail once," Tavarez said quietly. "And it nearly broke a trellis in half this time." 

Jonah stared at the still of his own hand on the valve.

"So which is it," he asked. "Protective factor or risk?"

"Both," Dr. Hsiao said. "That's why you're here instead of already reassigned."

The table flickered. New panes opened to either side of the incident still.

On the left: Samuel, seated in this same room on an earlier cycle, hands folded much like Jonah's now. The ship had captured his words and smoothed the audio, but the cadence was still Samuel's.

"My son has been scared of breaking things since he was small," Samuel's recorded voice said. "You know that. Your logs know that. He's been careful because of it. He double-checks seals no one else looks at. He pulls kids off rails and feels sick for days. What happened in G-3 wasn't him deciding rules didn't matter. It was him hitting the limit of what he thought he was allowed to risk to keep other people breathing."

Jonah's throat closed. He hadn't been in the room when Samuel said it. Hearing it now felt indecent, like eavesdropping on a prayer.

On the right pane: Sera, back straight, eyes steady. She wore her steward band; her voice was quieter than Samuel's but no less certain.

"Jonah's override hurt people," she said. "We all know that. We also know what the projections looked like for downstream loops if he hadn't touched the panel." She glanced off-screen, perhaps at a graph. "G-3 got injured workers and a mess. G-5 and G-6 got spared a flood over families. He didn't decide to be a hero. He panicked in the exact shape you've been training into him for years: don't walk away, don't leave the beam taking all the load, don't let three percent slip."

There was a faint, bitter humor at the edge of her mouth. "You don't get to benefit from that pattern and then act surprised when it shows up under pressure."

"Statements from Samuel Hale and Sera Solano are logged as stabilizing contextual data," the Companion added. "They reduce projected risk of future uncontrolled episodes under treatment by a median of nineteen percent."

"So," Malik said, looking from the panes back to Jonah, "we are weighing two narratives. In one, you are an unacceptable variable in a system that cannot afford surprises. In the other, you are a person whose very real risks are mitigated by insight, treatment, and the people who refuse to let you carry this alone."

Jonah almost laughed. "And you're asking the Ship which story costs less."

"We're asking both the Ship and ourselves," Tavarez said. "Because if we treat you like a faulty part, everyone who shares your indices will hear that."

The Companion's light ring dimmed a fraction.

"For the record," it said, "Core analysis does not currently recommend deactivation of subject Hale's engineer status."

The word deactivation made something behind Jonah's ribs flinch.

"Clarify deactivation," he said. "In this context."

"Removal of access to high-autonomy decision nodes and authority roles," the AI replied. "Reassignment to low-impact duties with continued monitoring. Physical harm is neither intended nor authorized."

"You'd put me in a box where I can't touch anything that matters," he said.

"We would place you where the probability of your actions causing catastrophic harm is negligible," it said. "That is the definition of safety used here."

"For who," he asked. "For me or for you."

No one answered immediately.

"Safety is not a zero-sum resource," Malik said at last. "But we do have to admit that limits on your access would make some people sleep easier. Including you, maybe."

He thought of the hum in the racks, the yellow pre-critical icon, the way his hands had shaken in medbay when he watched himself move on screen.

"I don't…want to hurt anyone," he said. "I also don't know who I am if I'm not the person holding up my corner of the hull."

The admission hung between them like condensation.

"Is there a middle path," Dr. Hsiao asked the Companion. "Short of a binary keep him / shelf him."

"Yes," it said. "Maintain engineer role with restrictions: no solo night-watch on critical nodes; no unsupervised manual overrides on main loops; mandatory rest band adherence; continued pharmacological and therapeutic support; peer check-ins flagged as mission-support, not voluntary." 

"And if I agree," Jonah said slowly, "I'm not a ticking bomb in your model?"

"Your risk profile remains above cohort baseline," the AI said. "But within an acceptable band when weighted with support structures."

Acceptable. It sounded like the grade you gave a weld you hoped no one would lean on too hard.

"You would also," Malik added, "participate in a working group on psychological safety and AI oversight. The council believes residents should help design the systems that monitor them."

Jonah blinked. "You want the broken guy on the committee."

"We want someone who knows exactly what it feels like to sit where you are," Tavarez said. "So the next person doesn't have to hear their life reduced to an index without a human in the room saying, *this is more complicated*."

He looked at the stills again: his hand on metal, the collapse, the stretcher. Samuel's lined face. Sera's steady eyes.

He thought of Lydia, alone at the table, no committee convened, no model that had known enough to be afraid.

"If I say no," he asked quietly, "what happens?"

"Core will still recommend partial restriction," the Companion said. "Council may still vote to implement it.Consent modifies pathways but does not erase risk."

Samuel's recorded voice, still hanging in the air from earlier, seemed to answer anyway: *He’s more than his indices.*

"And if I say yes," Jonah said, "you keep me where I can still touch the hull. With supervision. With meds. With graphs."

"With us," Tavarez said. "With people looking back at you instead of just at your numbers."

It was, he realized, the same choice Ruth had framed without graphs: trust other hands on the metal, or pretend you could hold the Ship by yourself.

"Companion," he said. "Log my consent to restricted engineer duties, full treatment plan, and committee work."

There was that familiar half-second pause.

"Annotation recorded," the AI said. "Subject Hale consents to continued high-responsibility work under enhanced safeguards. Deactivation is not recommended at this time."

The words landed with less relief than he would have expected. They felt less like a reprieve and more like a contract.

"This review will be revisited in one year or upon significant change in your condition," Dr. Hsiao said. "You're not being given a lifetime verdict today."

Jonah exhaled. "The Ship likes its rolling updates."

"So do people," Malik said. "We are not finished versions of ourselves."

The display dimmed. His various selves—the case file, the incident still, the son and steward's testimony—faded back into the table.

"Do you have any questions for us," Tavarez asked.

He thought of all the questions that would keep him up later. Why did you wait so long to tighten the net? Why didn't you catch Lydia sooner? How many others like me are you watching and hoping don't tip?

"Just one," he said. "When you run the model now, after this, what do you call me? Asset? Risk? Warning?"

The Companion's light ring brightened by a fraction.

"Resident," it said. "With elevated support priority."

It was the closest the Ship had ever come to saying his name without tacking a role or an index to it.

He stood on legs that remembered the stretcher and the corridor and the way the gardens had narrowed to a tunnel of light. His knees held.

"That will have to do," he said.

Outside, somewhere in the ring, the hull kept humming. Other hands held it. For the first time, Jonah let himself believe that included his—but not only his.
