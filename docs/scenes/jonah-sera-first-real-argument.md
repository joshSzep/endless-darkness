# Scene: Jonah and Sera’s First Real Argument

## Context
- POV: close third, Jonah
- Tense: past
- Placement: Late Act II / very early Act III — after they’ve built real warmth (e.g. multiple shared shifts in the gardens) but before obvious crisis flags.
- Tone: intimate, low-volume, honest and frightening; no shouting, just the quiet terror of recognizing Lydia-patterns in himself.

---

The gardens were closed to the public when they finally fought.

Not that there was a sign for it. The access door still cycled open to Jonah’s palm, the Companion still murmured a soft *good evening* from the ceiling node, the air still wrapped itself around him in that thick, plant-damp warmth.

But the day crews were gone. The volunteers had left with their carts of cut greens. Only the skeleton lights along the rows burned now, washing everything in dim, green-edged shadow.

Somewhere further in, a pump cycled with a clunk he normally found reassuring.

Tonight, it sounded like a missed heartbeat.

He found Sera at the far end of a row of trellised beans, her back to him, sleeves rolled to her elbows. She was checking supports, fingers moving with automatic care—pinch here, adjust there, smooth a leaf that had gotten twisted.

He watched her for a moment, the way her shoulders moved under her coverall, the way her weight shifted to keep balance on the grated walk.

He almost turned around.

*You should go*, a voice in him said. *You will only make this worse. Let her have one quiet night without you hanging off her like a loose panel.*

Instead he cleared his throat.

"Hey," he said.

She didn’t jump. She never did. She finished what she was doing with the current vine before straightening. Only then did she turn, wiping her hands on the rag at her belt.

"You’re off-shift," she said.

It wasn’t an accusation, exactly. Just a statement.

"So are you," he said.

"This is my version of not working," she said. One corner of her mouth ticked up. "You?"

He shifted the strap of his bag on his shoulder, suddenly aware of its weight.

"Couldn’t sleep," he said.

She studied his face for a long second. He knew what she’d see: the bruised smudges under his eyes, the too-bright focus.

"Lift outage again?" she asked.

"No," he said. "Just…noise. In my head. Thought walking might help."

"And you walked here," she said.

He had. Without checking the route, without registering the small detours in corridor signage.

"I guess," he said.

She nodded once, like she’d expected that answer.

"Well," she said. "As long as you’re here, you can make yourself useful. You mind checking the flow on row nine? Companion flagged a minor variance."

He seized on the task like a handhold.

"Sure," he said. "Send me the logs."

"Already did," she said.

He blinked down at his wrist. The notification was there, glowing patiently. He hadn’t felt the ping. His pulse had been too loud.

He moved down the row, ducking under a stretch of vine. The wet smell of nutrient solution rose as he knelt by the access panel. Numbers woke easily for him, even when sleep wouldn’t. His hands knew what to do.

Behind him, he could hear Sera moving along the trellis, metal clips clicking softly as she worked. The ordinary sounds of her care.

He had almost convinced himself this could pass as any other shared shift when she said, quietly:

"You didn’t answer my last three messages."

Jonah’s fingers paused on the panel latch. The metal bit into his palm.

"I was busy," he said.

The words came out too fast.

"You were awake," she said. "There’s a difference."

He swallowed. "I had overflow from the spine. Routing changed. Evaluations coming up. I didn’t want to—"

*Burden you* was the end of that sentence. He cut it off before it could escape.

"—distract you," he finished lamely.

A leaf brushed his neck as she moved closer. He focused on the display as if it could block her out.

"Jonah," she said.

He pretended not to hear.

"Companion," he said instead. "Show me nine delta flow, last twelve hours."

The local node chimed. "Displaying."

A small graph blinked into existence on the underside of the panel. There was a shallow dip six hours back, nothing catastrophic.

"Minor obstruction," he muttered. "I can clear it without rerouting."

He reached for a tool.

Sera’s hand settled on the edge of the open panel, just inside his field of view. Damp, callused, steady.

"I’m not asking about the pipe," she said.

He kept his eyes on the graph.

"We’re fine," he said. "I’m fine."

"That’s not true," she said.

The words were soft. They landed like a dropped tool in a silent room.

He felt his jaw clench.

"You don’t get to decide that," he said.

"I don’t," she agreed. "But I do get to notice when the person I’m—" She stopped, rewound. "When my friend disappears for four days and shows up looking like he hasn’t slept in two weeks."

Friend.

His chest did a small, treacherous thing at the word.

He tightened a connection that didn’t need tightening.

"People lose sleep sometimes," he said. "It’s not—"

"This isn’t sometimes," she said. "This is a pattern. You push until you’re shaking, then you vanish until you can pretend you’re not."

He snorted, sharp and humorless.

"You’ve known me how long," he said, "and you think you can map my patterns?"

"Long enough to know when you’re lying to me," she said.

Something hot flared under his ribs.

He slammed the panel shut harder than he meant to. The metal rang. A few leaves trembled from the vibration.

"I’m not your project," he said.

Sera didn’t flinch.

"I know," she said.

"Then stop treating me like one," he said. "You don’t get to…run diagnostics every time my messages don’t line up with your expectations."

He stepped around her, needing space. The row felt narrow, the air too wet.

"Jonah," she said again.

He kept moving. Past the beans, past the peppers they’d bullied into behaving on another night. The Companion followed him politely from node to node.

"Corridor door is that way," it offered quietly when he veered.

He ignored it.

"You sound like her," he said.

He hadn’t meant to say that out loud.

Sera’s footsteps stopped.

"Like who?" she asked.

"My mother," he said. The word felt like a loose bolt rattling in his mouth. "Hovering over everyone’s temperature, making charts in her head about who’s too loud, who’s too quiet. Turning people into…into case files."

Sera’s face tightened, not with offense but with something like grief.

"Is that what you think I’m doing?" she asked. "Turning you into a case file?"

"What else would you call it?" he said. "You and the Ship and your kiosks and your gentle questions—"

He heard himself and wanted, for a split second, to claw the words back. They came faster instead.

"You watch me work, you watch me crack a little at the edges, and suddenly I’m a pre-critical flag with a recommended environment. Gardens. Sera. Stabilizing influence."

The phrase tasted like rust. He hadn’t been told that explicitly. He’d heard enough in the way Companions routed his shifts.

"I am not a parameter," he said.

Sera took a breath. He could see her stop herself from glancing at the nearest node.

"Look at me," she said.

He didn’t.

"Jonah."

Her voice didn’t sharpen often. When it did, it wasn’t loud. It just cut through.

He turned.

She was standing a meter away, hands loose at her sides, jaw set. Her eyes were tired. Not from him—he refused to believe that—but from a day that had been long before he walked in.

"You are not a parameter," she said. "You are not a project. You are not a stability bracket. You are a person I care about who has been scaring me."

The last word landed harder than the others.

"Scaring you how," he said. His voice had gone thin.

"You don’t just go quiet," she said. "You go…absent. You stand in front of me and your eyes are somewhere twenty corridors away. You take on extra shifts and pretend it’s about efficiency when you’re clearly running from something. You laugh at things that aren’t funny and then don’t laugh at all for days."

Her throat worked.

"You send me a message at three in the morning cycle about a valve anomaly, and when I ask if you’re all right you answer with telemetry," she said. "That scares me. Not because I think you’ll hurt me. Because I can’t tell if you’re going to hurt yourself by trying to be the only person between the Ship and disaster."

His heart hammered against his ribs.

"I’m just doing my job," he said weakly.

"You’re doing three people’s jobs," she said. "And you’re not letting anyone be with you while you do it."

"You don’t understand," he said.

"Then explain it," she said. "Preferably in words that aren’t memos."

He opened his mouth and found nothing stable to stand on.

He thought of Lydia at the table, eyes open and gone. Of Samuel’s hand on the hull. Of Alina’s small shoulders beside him at the viewport, both of them pretending the dark didn’t move.

"If I let go," he said quietly, "something breaks."

Sera’s expression softened, but she didn’t step closer.

"If you don’t let go," she said, "you break."

He laughed then, a sharp, ugly sound.

"Better me than the Ship," he said.

"No," she said. The word came out like a prayer and a command together. "That’s the lie you grew up on. That you’re acceptable collateral damage as long as the hull holds."

Silence pressed in around them. The plants rustled faintly in some invisible air current.

"You don’t get to say that wasn’t my choice," he said. "You don’t know what it was like."

"You’re right," she said. "I don’t. I know what it’s like watching you replay it."

He felt suddenly, viscerally tired.

"I can’t do this," he said. "I can’t stand here and…break open for you like some diagnostic cutaway."

"I’m not asking you to break open," she said. "I’m asking you not to shut the hatch in my face every time you hear a strange sound in your own head."

He shook his head.

"I don’t know how," he said.

The admission left him lightheaded.

Sera’s shoulders sagged a fraction.

"That," she said, "I believe."

They stood there, breathing the same wet air, not moving.

"You’re allowed to be angry with me," she added, after a moment. "You’re allowed to feel trapped. To think I’m too much, or not enough, or that I sound like your mother when I ask if you’ve eaten."

Her mouth twisted. "I hate that I remind you of that."

"It’s not you," he said quickly. "It’s—"

"The part of your brain that turns any concern into a threat," she said. "I know. I’ve met it."

Something in him wanted to apologize until his throat bled. Something else wanted to bolt for the door and never come back.

"So what now," he asked. "You’ve logged your objection. Do you want me to promise I’ll sleep eight hours and file regular emotional status reports?"

Sera exhaled through her nose.

"No," she said. "I want you to answer the next time I ask *are you all right* with something other than a system spec. Even if the answer is *no*. Especially then."

He stared at her.

"That’s it?" he asked.

"For tonight," she said. "Yes."

"And if I can’t," he said.

"Then I will be here in the gardens," she said, "and you will know where to find me when you decide you’d rather not be alone with it."

Her voice didn’t wobble. That, somehow, hurt more than if she’d shouted.

"You’re still…here," he said, stupidly.

"I’m angry," she said. "And scared. And I’m not going anywhere. All three things can be true."

He didn’t know what to do with that.

They went back to work after that—not because anything had been neatly resolved, but because the plants didn’t care about human timing. Row nine still needed its obstruction cleared. The trellises still needed checking.

He knelt again, hands moving through the familiar tasks, mind buzzing.

Every so often, he felt Sera’s presence at the edge of his vision. Not hovering. Not gone.

Just there.

He didn’t look up when he finally said, very quietly, "I’m not all right."

The words hung between them, fragile as a cracked pipe.

Sera’s hand brushed his shoulder, light as a leaf.

"I know," she said. "Thank you for telling me."

The Ship hummed softly around them, unaware of the tiny adjustment in one of its more fragile systems.
