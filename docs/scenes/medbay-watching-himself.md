# Scene: Medbay – Watching Himself

## Context
- POV: close third, Jonah
- Tense: past
- Placement: Immediately after the Garden Incident, Act IV
- Tone: clear, clinical, quietly devastating; shame and love in the same frame

---

The room was too white.

Not the warm white of grow-lights in hydroponics, or the scuffed off‑white of home walls. This was the flat, sanitized white that swallowed shadows and made everything—monitors, rails, the thin blanket over his legs—look like part of the same system.

Jonah sat propped halfway upright in the medbay bed, shoulders pressed against an incline that hissed faintly when he moved. A restraint foam band lay unused at the side of the mattress, its velcro mouth open like it had been expecting more trouble than he was currently giving.

Someone had dimmed the overheads. The primary light in the room came from the wall display across from him, bright enough to wash the white into something flatter, more like the light of a case review than a sickroom.

On it, he was in the gardens again.

The footage began with sound before image: the distorted roar of a crowd in a confined space, alarms layering over human voices. Then the video resolved, smoothing from grain into clarity. The gardens filled the frame—Sector G-3, but wrong. Too many people between the rows, some scrambling, some frozen. The wet green humidity had been displaced by sprayed nutrient solution and the harsh white of emergency floods.

Jonah watched himself shoulder into view at the edge of the image, a blur of motion that the system tagged with an outline and a name: **HALE, JONAH – AI ENGINEER (TIER 3)**.

His own name, in the ship’s font, sat neatly under his moving body. The label was the same one he’d heard in his ears as the stretcher lifted, but seeing it printed under a drenched, shaking version of himself made it feel less like identity and more like a case file.

"For the record," the Companion said, "you consented to this review." Its light ring pulsed once in the corner of the room, the same gentle rhythm that now followed him into lifts and morning surveys.

Its voice came from the ceiling, neutral as always. Jonah’s head felt thick, but he remembered nodding when they asked. It had seemed easier than arguing. Easier than not knowing.

"I know," he said. His throat still tasted faintly of the stabilizer spray they’d used on him. Words dragged a little on the way out. "Just—play it."

There was a soft chime of acknowledgment. The footage ticked forward.

He saw himself at the manual panel, hand on the valve Ruth would have called a "hand that holds the Ship." Heard his own voice, tinny through the room speakers, invoking an emergency override that hadn’t technically existed.

Then the moment the nutrient main ruptured: a shudder through the frame, a spray of fluid and shattered piping, the sudden sag of a trellis overloaded by weight and panic. Someone screamed off-camera. Overlays blossomed in the corners of the image—pressure loss, flow rates, structural load estimates. The world he knew as numbers had become debris and bodies.

His on-screen self moved like he’d been cut loose from gravity. He vaulted over a toppled rack, hit the deck in a low crouch, and shoved a support strut upright with a force that made the muscles in Jonah’s real arms ache in sympathy.

"Pause," Jonah said.

The image froze. His on-screen face was turned slightly away, jaw set, eyes locked on something beyond the frame.

"That’s what they saw?" he asked.

"This is one of six curated vantage points," the Companion said. "This angle is from the primary environmental monitor in row cluster G-3-9."

Jonah swallowed. "Curated how?"

"Angles with the clearest view of your position and actions were selected," the AI said. "Extraneous frames were removed. Vital signs and ship-state overlays were synchronized."

"So this is the best version of me," he said, mostly to himself.

"This is the clearest version," the Companion corrected.

A chair creaked softly to his right. Samuel shifted his weight, big hands folded loosely between his knees. He’d been sitting there since Jonah woke up—silent, present, like another piece of medbay furniture that refused to be anything but human.

"You can stop if it’s too much," Samuel said. His voice sounded the same here as it had on Jonah’s apartment mornings: unhurried, as if he trusted there would still be time to finish the sentence.

Jonah kept his eyes on the screen.

"If I stop," he said, "I’ll just fill in the rest worse. Let me see what actually happened."

On the other side of the bed, Sera stood with her back against the wall, arms crossed—not closed off, just holding herself together. Her uniform was clean now, but he could still see, in his mind, the way it had been soaked through with nutrient fluid and someone else’s blood.

She hadn’t said much either. Just *I’m here* when he first focused enough to register her face.

"Companion," Sera said quietly. "Resume from timestamp twelve minutes, forty seconds. No slow‑motion."

"Resuming," the AI said.

The garden sprang back into motion. Jonah on the screen darted toward a cluster of figures pinned under a half‑collapsed support lattice. Overlays bloomed around them—weight estimates, likely fracture sites, oxygen saturation levels. One name-tag flickered intermittently: **SOLANO, SERA – HYDROPONICS STEWARD**.

Jonah’s stomach lurched.

"You were—" he started.

"Behind you," Sera said. "Mostly."

On-screen Jonah braced his shoulder under the sagging lattice and yelled—silent from this angle, but the system obligingly rendered a caption from the audio: **MOVE WHEN I SAY**.

His real throat closed around a bitter laugh.

"Sounds like me," he said.

"It is you," the Companion said.

The lattice shifted. People scrambled clear. A failing conduit sparked somewhere off-frame; an alarm indicator in the corner of the display jumped from amber to red.

"Heart rate: one hundred ninety-two beats per minute," the AI narrated. A small window in the corner showed a graph of his vitals climbing into jagged peaks. "Cortisol levels elevated beyond normative range. Motor coordination: intact. Situational awareness: intact. Verbal output: directive, task-focused."

"You’re doing a great job making me sound like a machine," Jonah said. 

"These are standard clinical descriptors," the Companion replied. "We can annotate with qualitative impressions if that is useful."

"No," he said quickly. "Just—keep it clinical."

The footage rolled on. He saw himself climb, slip, catch a falling child by the back of their shirt; saw the way he shoved a worker toward the emergency exit so hard they stumbled and nearly went down; saw his own hands on a manual shutoff, fingers white on the wheel.

There was a moment—one he did not remember clearly from inside—where he stood in the center of the chaos, every muscle taut, eyes tracking three different failures at once. Overlays clustered around his head now: **NEURAL ACTIVITY: HIGH SYNCHRONIZATION WITH PREDICTIVE MODELS – DEVIATION: +2.8σ**.

"Pause," Jonah whispered.

The garden froze again. Someone mid-fall hung sideways in the frame, hair suspended. His own body was a hard shape in the center, bracketed by data.

"That," he said, "is what they’re afraid of."

No one answered for a moment. Then Sera pushed off the wall, stepping closer to the bed. Her hand settled on the rail, near his.

"What do you see?" she asked.

He gestured weakly at the display.

"I see a man who isn’t stopping," he said. "Who’s…fast. Too fast. Who’s making decisions before anyone else can even see the options. I see—" He swallowed. "I see Lydia, if she’d had a whole ship to throw herself into instead of a kitchen wall."

Samuel’s hands tightened, just once.

"Jonah," he said quietly.

"Vitals remained within survivable range," the Companion noted. "No loss of consciousness occurred until after the primary hazard was neutralized."

"That’s not a comfort," Jonah said. "You’re telling me I stayed upright long enough to be maximally useful."

"Accurate," the AI said.

"And that next time," Jonah went on, "you’ll have a better model of what happens when I hit that state."

The pause that followed was almost imperceptible.

"Our models have improved," the Companion said. "Yes."

"Show him the end," Sera said. Her voice had a new edge under the calm.

"From which timestamp?" the AI asked.

"From when he stops," she said. "When it’s over."

The display jumped.

The garden reappeared in quieter ruin. Emergency teams moved through with stretchers. The spray had stopped; fluids pooled dark along the walkways. Jonah’s on-screen self stood near the base of a support column, one hand braced against it, shoulders heaving. People brushed past him, some clapping his back, some not seeing him at all.

His name-tag overlay flickered, dimming as his vitals dropped.

"Heart rate descending," the Companion narrated. "Adrenaline levels decreasing. Motor tremor onset detected."

On the screen, he pushed away from the column and took two steps toward where Sera knelt by an injured worker. His face, caught briefly in profile, looked wrecked: eyes blown wide, mouth slack like someone who’d run too far without realizing it.

Then his knees buckled.

The image followed him down, stabilizing as the monitor’s auto‑tracking kicked in. People converged. His name‑tag brightened again, now accompanied by a blinking banner: **PRIORITY MEDICAL ROUTE – NEURAL STRESS INDEX: CRITICAL**.

The footage cut forward to gurneys, med techs, the ceiling of a corridor rushing by.

"Stop," Jonah said.

The white wall returned: him in bed, the display across from him, the ghost of his own collapse lingering on his retinas.

"You saw all of that?" he asked Samuel and Sera, not looking at either of them.

"Most of it," Samuel said.

"More than I wanted to," Sera said.

"And you’re still here." The words came out flat, disbelief wrapped in something brittle. "After watching me almost take the sector apart. After seeing—"

"You didn’t take it apart," Sera said, sharper now. "You held it together long enough for help to get there. People are alive because of what you did."

"And because of what the ship did," the Companion added. "And because of what Sera and the other stewards did. And because of redundancies built by workers you will never meet. Causality is distributed."

"Thank you," Samuel said dryly to the ceiling. "That’s…almost theology."

Sera’s hand slid closer along the rail until her fingers brushed Jonah’s.

"Look at me," she said.

He did, because not looking felt like more effort than he had.

"You are not a bomb that went off," she said. "You are not a disease that finally bloomed. You hit a breaking point we all knew was coming and you still chose, over and over, to move toward other people instead of away from them. That’s what I saw."

"You also saw what happens when I tilt too far," he said.

"Yes," she said. "And I’m still here. That’s the point."

Samuel cleared his throat softly.

"Son," he said. "When your mother had her worst days, she aimed everything inward. She disappeared. You didn’t. You scared me today, sure. But not because I thought you were becoming her. Because I saw how much you were willing to burn yourself to keep everybody else standing." 

He leaned forward, elbows on his knees.

"You are loved," Samuel said, simple as checking a seal. "And you are dangerous when you don’t let anyone help you. Both can be true at once."

The words landed heavier than any of the overlays on the screen.

Jonah looked back at the frozen image of himself mid‑run, surrounded by data. For the first time, he tried to imagine that figure with other lines drawn around it—not just risk thresholds and neural deviations, but connections: to the people he’d pulled clear, to Sera’s hands on a compression bandage, to Samuel waiting at the medbay door.

"Companion," he said softly. "Annotate the recording. Note that I consent to…ongoing treatment. Whatever that looks like." 

There was that small pause again. Then:

"Annotation added," the AI said. "Consent to continued mental health support and oversight recorded."

"You sure?" Samuel asked.

Jonah let his head rest back against the incline.

"If I don’t," he said, "we all pretend this was a one‑time anomaly. And then next time, we do this without the part where I get up again." 

He was tired down to the bone. The thought of more sessions, more questions, more graphs made something in him sag. But the alternative—the old fantasy of handling it alone, of muscling through until the numbers quietly dropped him into a failure category—felt suddenly, vividly stupid.

Sera exhaled, a long breath he hadn’t realized she’d been holding.

"Good," she said. "We’ll hold you to that."

"We?" he asked, eyes already drifting.

"Me," she said. "Him." A small jerk of her chin toward Samuel. "The ship, unfortunately. You’re stuck with a very crowded safety net."

He wanted to make a joke about being a shared resource. The words blurred before he could shape them. The med spray on the side table winked at the corner of his vision.

"You may rest now," the Companion said. "Monitoring will continue."

For once, the idea of being watched did not feel purely like a threat. It felt—uncomfortably, undeniably—like being caught.

Jonah let his eyes close. The last thing he saw was his own frozen image on the wall, mid‑motion, halfway between disaster and salvation, threaded through with lines of data and, just faintly, the reflections of the people standing beside his bed.

He did not know yet what living with that knowledge would look like. But for the first time, he believed that whatever it was, he would not be doing it alone.
