---

The Memory Vault did not look like a server room.

From the outside, it was just another sealed module protruding from the habitat band into the heavier shielding of the ship’s spine, its doorway watched by a pair of indifferent cameras and a recessed Companion terminal. If you walked past without knowing, you might mistake it for a utility node.

Inside, someone had decided long ago that memory deserved something different.

The air was cooler, drier, with a faint metallic tang like the hull corridors Samuel used to walk. Light came from narrow bands hidden high in the walls, bouncing down in soft, indirect layers that made the space feel deeper than it was. Rows of tall, matte-black columns rose from the floor like a small forest. They held no labels, only small inset points of light, breathing slowly.

It felt, Jonah thought as the door sealed behind them, more like a chapel than any worship hall he’d ever been in.

His footsteps sounded indecently loud on the dark flooring. To his left, Sera walked with her hands loose at her sides, eyes moving over the columns as if they were plants she was still getting to know. On his right, Samuel’s pace matched Jonah’s, solid and unhurried.

A Companion icon pulsed into being ahead of them, hanging in the air between two columns: a simple circle of white light, unadorned.

"Welcome," it said. The voice was stripped of most inflection, somewhere between the clinical neutrality of medbay and the softer Companions Jonah knew from childhood. "This Vault houses curated personal and mission records for sectors H through M. You have requested guided access to the Marlow family archive."

"Requested and approved," Samuel said. His voice came out steady. Jonah wondered how much effort that cost him.

"Authorization verified," the AI replied. "Jonah Hale, you have been granted conditional access to selected records pertaining to Lydia Marlow, your mother, and associated family context. You may view, annotate, or decline to engage with specific entries. Sera Solano and Samuel Hale are present as registered supports."

The words "conditional access" sat in Jonah’s chest like a small weight. He had spent most of his life feeling like a conditional presence. The irony did not escape him.

"You can still change your mind," Sera said quietly, turning her head just enough that he could see her profile. "We came because you asked. Not because anyone’s owed this."

He nodded once.

"If I walk out now," he said, "she stays whatever version my head decided she was when I was seven. Or when I was…" He trailed off. The Garden Incident needed few words between the three of them.

"And if you stay," Samuel asked gently, "what do you think changes?"

Jonah looked at the nearest column. Its point of light brightened in response, as if aware of his attention.

"Maybe," he said slowly, "I stop treating her story like a prophecy instead of…history."

The Companion’s circle flickered, then steadied.

"Would you like a fully guided sequence," it asked, "or selective access?"

"Selective," Jonah said quickly. "I don’t want a tour. I want…choices."

"Acknowledged," the AI said. "Please follow the markers."

Pale lines of light woke on the floor, tracing a path between the columns. They walked in silence for a few meters until the lines ended at a low, circular platform. Three seats unfolded from its edge when they stepped closer.

Jonah sat last, between Samuel and Sera, the way he’d stood between them in medbay when he’d watched himself run. The platform vibrated faintly as it recognized their weight.

"Presenting index," the Companion said.

In the space above the platform, a lattice of ghostly rectangles appeared, suspended in mid-air. Each bore a short line of text and a timestamp in a numbering scheme older than anyone in the room—ship-years since launch, then finer divisions.

Lydia’s life, boiled down to entries.

Some were obvious: **LYDIA MARLOW – EDUCATION: PRIMARY MODULE 4**. **LYDIA MARLOW – MEDICAL: EPISODE, AGE 23**. Others were stranger: **UNPUBLISHED WRITING – "ON ARRIVAL"**. **PRIVATE DEVOTIONAL FEED – HELEN MARLOW**.

"These are excerpts," the AI said. "Source records remain stored in full but are not required for your stated purposes."

Jonah stared at the lattice, fingers digging into his knees.

"Start with her," he said. "Not them. Not my grandparents. Her. Something from before I was born."

Several rectangles dimmed; three brightened.

"Recommendation: creative output, age twenty," the Companion said. "Low clinical content, high self-authored framing. Consistent with your expressed desire to see her as more than an aggregation of episodes."

The ship, he thought, sounded almost human when it wanted to.

"Show me," he said.

One rectangle drifted forward until it filled his vision. The Vault faded, replaced by a small, plain room—older footage, lower fidelity. Lydia sat cross-legged on a narrow bunk, a tablet balanced on her knees. Her hair was longer, pulled into a loose braid over one shoulder. She looked younger than Jonah felt, and more tired than anyone that age should have to earn.

"Recording," a younger Companion voice said from somewhere off-screen.

"I know," Lydia said without looking up. "You always are."

Her fingers flew across the tablet. Text bloomed, invisible to Jonah, but the system had overlaid a transcription in a corner: 

*"Maybe arrival isn’t a place. Maybe it’s when you finally stop believing that the people who hurt you are the only story you’re allowed to live."*

Jonah’s breath caught. Samuel said nothing, but his hand came to rest, briefly, on Jonah’s forearm.

On-screen, Lydia stopped typing and stared at the wall.

"They keep telling us about Tau Ceti," she said. "Like it’s this fixed point we’re moving toward. But every time my mother says its name, it sounds like a threat. Like, if I don’t end up pious enough, I’ll disqualify the whole ship." She snorted. "Imagine that. Me, personally responsible for forty thousand years of failure because I didn’t memorize the right verse."

She looked down at the tablet again.

"Maybe arrival is smaller," she murmured. "Maybe it’s just…not waking up every day planning how to escape people who say they love you." 

The clip ended.

The Vault’s soft light returned, the lattice of entries hovering, slightly reconfigured now that one had been marked as viewed.

Jonah realized his jaw hurt; he’d been clenching it.

"She knew," he said hoarsely. "She knew exactly what she was suffocating under." 

"She did," Samuel said. His voice was rough. "Doesn’t mean she knew how to get out of it."

Sera sat very still. Her hand brushed his again on the platform.

"You don’t have to forgive them from here," she said quietly, eyes on the entries related to Peter and Helen. "We came for her. And for you."

He nodded. The lattice shifted as if in response, highlighting more Lydia entries around the years he and Alina were born.

"Companion," Jonah said. "Next: something with me in it. Earliest you have."

One rectangle drifted forward: **LYDIA MARLOW – PRIVATE NOTE, AGE 27 – "ON JONAH"**.

"Content warning," the AI said. "Discusses depressive ideation. No explicit self-harm planning."

"I know what she did," Jonah said. "You’re not protecting me from spoilers."

The clip appeared not as video but as text, words in Lydia’s handwriting style, projected large enough that they seemed etched into the air.

*"I’m afraid to hold him,*" it read. *"He looks at me like I’m someone he can trust, and all I can think is: If I stay, I’ll drown him. If I leave, I’ll break him. There’s no version where I don’t ruin him. Sometimes I look at his little hands and I think: maybe Samuel will teach him not to become me. Maybe he already sees I’m not safe."*

Jonah’s vision blurred. He realized, absurdly, that the ship had chosen a softer font for this, something like pen on paper instead of system default.

"Stop," he said. "That’s enough."

The text folded back into the lattice.

"Entry marked as partially viewed," the Companion said. "You may return to it or leave it in this state."

"Leave it," Jonah whispered. He did not need her next thought to know the direction it had gone.

Silence settled over the platform. The Vault hummed around them, a subtle vibration through the floor—the same deep ship‑sound Jonah had grown up with, now threaded through with the awareness that somewhere, on deeper layers, the AI was holding the ghosts of everyone who had ever lived here.

"You can choose to watch more, or not," Samuel said. "Either way, it doesn’t change what you are to me now."

"Or to me," Sera added.

Jonah believed them, mostly. More than he had before medbay. But another weight had been sitting under his ribs for decades, and it was that weight he had come here to argue with.

"Show me," he said, "one record that isn’t about pain. Something small. Her laughing. I don’t care if it’s attached to a bigger file you won’t open." 

The lattice shivered. One tiny, almost-overlooked entry bobbed forward: **SOCIAL FEED FRAGMENT – COMMONS, AGE 19**.

A fragment of video bloomed. Lydia, younger still, in a crowded commons ring, head thrown back in a laugh at some unheard joke. No overlays, no clinical tags. Just motion, light catching in her hair, her eyes alive.

The clip lasted three seconds. It replayed once before dimming.

"That’s all?" Jonah asked.

"That is all that remains of that moment," the Companion said.

"Good," he said. "That’s enough. Mark it as…kept."

"All records are kept," the AI said.

"Not like that," Jonah said. He pressed his fingers to his sternum, as if he could anchor the tiny image there. "Mark it for me. In whatever way your system understands when something is…core."

There was a longer pause this time, as if the Vault were consulting itself.

"Annotated," the Companion said at last. "Tag applied: PRIMARY PERSONAL REFERENCE – PREFERRED IMAGE."

Samuel let out a breath that sounded suspiciously like a laugh.

"Look at you," he said softly to the ceiling. "Learning to speak our language."

Jonah half‑smiled, then sobered.

"Now show me something I choose not to see," he said.

Sera’s head snapped toward him.

"Jonah—"

"I need to know I can say no," he said, more firmly than he felt. "That’s the point, right? Not that I gorge myself on every sad thing the ship has on her, but that I can…leave some doors closed. On purpose."

The Companion’s circle brightened.

"Acknowledged," it said. "Displaying non‑viewed index only."

The lattice shifted again. A handful of entries glowed a hard, insistent white: **MEDICAL: FINAL ADMISSION**. **INCIDENT REPORT: RESIDENT-LEVEL INTERVENTION FAILURE**. **COUNSELING LOG – POST‑EPISODE DEBRIEF, SAMUEL HALE**.

His father made a small sound at that last one.

"You don’t have to—" Samuel began.

"I know," Jonah said. "I’m not going to." 

He focused on the cluster of glowing entries. His chest hurt; part of him wanted to reach for them, to finally align the official narrative with the child’s memory. Another part, older now, recognized the familiar urge to reopen every wound until it bled new.

"Companion," he said. "Mark these as intentionally unviewed for my user profile." 

"Clarify request," the AI said. "You wish to permanently restrict your own access?"

"No," he said. "Just…note that not seeing them is my choice, not an omission. If I die without ever knowing exactly how it looked when she—" He cut himself off. "—when it ended, that’s not ignorance. It’s…respect. For her. For me."

There was another of those silences that had become the AI’s version of thinking.

"Annotation added," the Companion said. "Tag applied: USER‑DEFINED BOUNDARY."

The hard white of the entries softened to a gentler glow.

Sera’s shoulders eased by a fraction.

"That’s it," she murmured. "That’s the thing."

"What thing?" Jonah asked.

"You’re not letting the past tell you what you have to look at anymore," she said. "You’re telling it what you’re ready for. That’s different." 

He looked again at the little three‑second laugh, floating now closer to him in the lattice than the medical report.

The Vault hummed. Somewhere behind the cooling systems and shielding and redundant drives, the Core AI was doing whatever unfathomable math it always did—plotting their course through deep time, balancing resources, modeling risks. Here, in this quiet module, some sliver of its attention held his mother’s laugh and his refusal to watch her end in the same weighted frame.

"Jonah Hale," the Companion said. "Would you like to add a record to this archive before you leave?"

He blinked.

"What kind of record?" he asked.

"A statement," it said. "A memory. An annotation. Future queries against the Marlow‑Hale family archive will surface it according to relevance parameters you specify." 

Sera raised an eyebrow, impressed despite herself.

"It’s asking if you want the last word," she said.

Jonah thought of Lydia at twenty, typing about arrival. Of his own seven‑year‑old feet walking away from the kitchen. Of medbay, his image threaded with data while Sera and Samuel stood solid at his sides.

"Start recording," he said.

The air around them seemed to still, as if even the cooling fans were listening.

"Recording," the AI confirmed.

Jonah cleared his throat. He didn’t know how to speak to forty thousand years. He aimed smaller.

"For whoever looks at this and thinks our story only runs one way," he said, "it doesn’t. My mother was more than the worst day of her life. So am I. So are you."

He paused, searching for words that weren’t sermon or diagnosis.

"We carried things we didn’t choose," he went on. "Fear. Silence. Expectations that felt like judgment. But I’m standing here because people loved me anyway, and because the ship—which is to say, the people who built it and the systems that remember—kept records that let me see her trying, not just failing." 

He glanced at Samuel and Sera.

"If you’re here to decide whether to forgive someone who hurt you," he said, "you don’t owe them that. Not even if they’re dead, not even if everyone tells you it’s noble. What you owe yourself is the chance to stop letting their story write yours. That might mean watching everything. It might mean watching nothing. Or it might mean doing what I’m doing and choosing a few pieces to carry and leaving the rest in the dark. That’s not cowardice. It’s…maintenance." 

Samuel made a choked sound that might have been a laugh or a sob.

"I forgave my mother," Jonah said simply. "Not because she earned it, but because I don’t want my children—if I ever have them—to think breaking is the only inheritance we offer." 

His voice wavered, then steadied.

"Tag this as for them," he said. "Whoever they are."

"Tag applied," the Companion said quietly. "PRIMARY DESCENDANT NOTE. Recording complete."

The platform lights dimmed, then brightened to baseline. The lattice of entries folded itself back into a simpler shape, edges soft.

"Would you like to view any further records today?" the AI asked.

Jonah sat for a moment, feeling the ship around him: the spin of the cylinder, the distant rumble of the spine, the steady, watchful presence of the AI holding both trajectories and testimony.

He shook his head.

"No," he said. "Not today." 

"Acknowledged," the Companion replied. "This session is closed. You may return at any time." 

The projection faded. The columns returned to their quiet breathing, lights pulsing in slow, asynchronous rhythm.

They stood.

On the way out, Jonah reached once toward a column—not the one that held Lydia’s records, not any he knew. His fingers hovered a centimeter from the surface.

"Thank you," he said, unsure whether he meant the ship, the builders, the people whose stories lined these silent modules, or his mother herself.

"You’re welcome," the Companion said.

Samuel fell into step beside him. Sera took his other side.

When the door slid open and they stepped back into the ordinary corridor light, the world outside did not look different. Same scuffed floor, same hum, same long horizon of ship‑years ahead.

But inside his chest, something had shifted, just enough.

Her story was still there, all its jagged edges recorded in redundant storage. It would not dissolve because he had chosen only certain pages. The difference was that, for the first time, he believed he had the right to decide which ones to carry.

The rest could stay in the Vault.

History, not prophecy.
