# Ordinary Family Shift Morning — Hale/Marlow Quarters

**Beat linkage:** Act I – 2. Life on the Ship (echo)

Morning came in panels, not sunrise.

The light over Jonah's bunk brightened by precise increments, cool white pushing back the soft gray of ship-night. It always started at his feet first, crawling up the bulkhead like someone opening a door very slowly. He lay still and watched it climb, counting the seconds between each little surge out of habit. The Companions called it "circadian ramp," as if a word like that could make it feel less like being measured.

On the bunk above, Alina had already peeled back her curtain. Her bare toes dangled over the edge, tracing invisible arcs in the air. She had pushed her light to "dawn" ten minutes early again, so her corner of the narrow cabin glowed warm while the rest still softened itself.

"You're going to blind yourself," Jonah muttered.

"I'm painting," she said.

He rolled onto his back to look up at her. The "painting" was a scrap of maintenance cloth she'd fixed to the underside of the bunk with sealant tabs. This week it was a smear of blues and rusts, streaked where the pigment hadn't dried before she pulled the curtain closed the night before. In the ramping light it looked like a slice of the river band he'd only seen on feeds.

"With what?" he asked. "We don't have any more—"

"Spare pigment from school," she said quickly. "They were going to wash it out anyway. I saved it. Recycling." She dangled one foot lower and nudged his shoulder. "Stop breathing like Ruth when she walks in on us playing with her beads. It's legal."

"Ruth's beads were blessed," Jonah said, but the complaint came out thin. He scrubbed his hands over his face, feeling the faint stipple of adolescent stubble that never quite filled in. "And they were hers."

"This was for a poster about proper gray-water usage." Alina's toes flexed. "I think God can survive without that particular sermon."

The door-seam light in the main room brightened, the Companions' way of prodding the rest of the quarters toward wakefulness. Through the thin wall he heard the hiss of the galley tap and the clink of metal against ceramic.

Samuel was up.

Jonah swung his legs over the side of the bunk and dropped to the floor. The deck was cool under his bare feet, the faint vibration of the Ship humming up through his bones. He paused for half a heartbeat, letting the hum settle under his skin, listening for anything out of place. Same as always: low, steady, with a slight higher tone that meant one of the maglev lines was running heavy somewhere above their sector.

He exhaled and reached for his work pants.

By the time he stepped into the main room, Samuel had two bowls on the narrow fold-out table and a third in his hand. He was still in his sleep shirt, but his workband was already buckled around his wrist, dark screen waiting for the morning's assignments. Steam curled from the pot on the galley unit; the smell of fortified grain porridge filled the small space, thin but warm.

"Morning," Samuel said.

"Morning." Jonah glanced at the wall clock without meaning to. It read 06:12 in small, merciless digits. His father's shift started at 07:00; the hull corridor was three lifts and two crossings away.

"You slept?" Samuel asked.

"Enough." Jonah lied automatically, then softened it. "Mostly."

Samuel's mouth hitched in a half-smile that didn't reach his eyes.

"Mostly's more than not at all," he said. "Sit. Eat."

The third bowl thunked onto the table as Alina shuffled in, rubbing at one eye with the heel of her palm. Her hair stuck out in lopsided twists where the sleep band had failed to keep it in place.

"You started without me," she complained.

"We waited for you," Samuel said. "The Ship didn't."

As if to illustrate the point, a Companion chime sounded from the wall panel, soft and unobtrusive. A neutral voice followed, speaking in the sector dialect that sat somewhere between formal Earth Standard and the clipped slang of the working bands.

"Working Ring C-3, morning hull integrity report available. No new critical breaches. Micro-impact log: two events, segments 14 and 19, both below threshold. Rotational variance within expected bounds. Please acknowledge if you are scheduled for external work between 07:00 and 19:00."

Samuel reached past Jonah to tap the panel, acknowledgment pinging back to whatever node was listening. The word "critical" sat in the air a little too long.

"See?" Alina said around a mouthful of porridge. "No new holes today. You can relax."

Samuel chuckled, a low sound.

"That's not how it works," he said. He picked up his spoon but didn't quite eat yet, gaze ticking to the ceiling as if he could see through bulkheads and support struts to the hull beyond. "No new critical breaches just means we haven't found the small ones yet."

"Comforting," Jonah muttered.

Samuel looked at him then, properly. His eyes were tired, but clear. There was always a residue of hull dust on him that no wash cycle could quite erase; Jonah thought of it as a second skin.

"It is comforting," Samuel said. "Because it means the Ship is telling us the truth. And it means I still have a job." He dipped his spoon, finally, and took a bite. "Eat. You'll need your head clear today for school."

"It's not just school," Jonah said. "We have the systems lab block. We're shadowing the Companion consoles." The words came out quicker than he'd intended, a small pulse of pride he couldn't quite hide.

Samuel's brows lifted.

"Console work," he repeated. "In C-3?"

"Just the training sim," Jonah said quickly. "Not real routing. We watch the calls, see how they balance load."

Alina perked up.

"Do you get to see the Command decks?" she asked. "The real ones, with the big displays?"

"Not from one lab," Jonah said. "Maybe later. If I do well."

Samuel's spoon hovered halfway to his mouth.

"You usually do," he said. The sentence carried no pressure, just fact, but Jonah heard the weight behind it anyway.

The panel chimed again, a gentle series this time. "Behavioral Stability appointments begin in forty-eight minutes. Please ensure minors are accompanied if scheduled." The same neutral tone, the same gently rounded syllables, but that phrase always rang sharper in Jonah's ears than any impact report.

He kept his gaze on his bowl.

"You're not scheduled today," Samuel said quietly. "That's Alina."

Alina made a face.

"It's just a check-in," she said. "They want to hear about my 'feelings about future vocational pathways'." She exaggerated the formal wording, making it ridiculous. "I told them I feel like not talking about it. They said that was a 'starting point'." She rolled her eyes.

"Ruth would say talking to them is like talking to a wall that writes things down," Samuel said.

"Ruth talks to walls all the time," Jonah said. "She blesses the lift before she gets in."

As if summoned, Ruth shuffled out from the sleeping alcove, wrapped in her worn robe, gray hair braided back. Her bare feet were silent on the deck, but the faint clack of her prayer beads against her wrist announced her as surely as any chime.

"Ruth talks to the One who hears through the wall," she corrected, not unkindly. "Morning, babies." She bent just enough to press a kiss to the top of Jonah's head, then Alina's shoulder. "Samuel."

"Ma," Samuel said. There was a quiet warmth in the word that Jonah never heard him use with anyone else.

Ruth brushed her fingers over the bulkhead by the table, the same patch of composite Samuel always checked as he left. Her lips moved, voice too low to catch the words, but Jonah knew the pattern: a thanks for holding, a plea to keep holding. She had taught it to him when he was small, his palm pressed against cold metal while she whispered about God and steel and faith as if they were all different faces of the same thing.

"You say it too," she told him now, catching his eye. "Even if it's just in here." She tapped his chest with two fingers. "Ship listens better when we do our part."

Jonah nodded, unsure whether she meant the AI or something beyond it. Maybe she didn't see a difference.

"I'll walk Alina to her appointment," Ruth said, reaching for a bowl. "Samuel, you finish eating. You look like a man about to go out on an empty tank."

"Yes, Ma," Samuel said, that half-smile again.

They fell into a familiar rhythm then: spoons scraping, the hiss of the galley as Ruth rinsed a stray cup, Alina humming some half-remembered melody under her breath as she swallowed faster than was wise. Jonah watched his family move around the small space and, for once, did not try to count all the places this morning could go wrong.

The hull report had said "no new critical breaches." The Behavioral Stability chime had not included his name. The Ship's hum under his feet was steady.

Maybe, he thought, as he finished his bowl and stood to clear it, this was what normal was supposed to feel like: frail and noisy and crowded, but whole.

Samuel rose too, setting his bowl aside. He checked his workband, thumb skimming the morning's assignments that had just populated the screen. Jonah saw the tiny crease appear between his brows as he read—a familiar micro-expression that meant there was more work than there were hands, that some segment's plate count had come up wrong in the night.

"Bad?" Jonah asked before he could stop himself.

Samuel glanced at him, then deliberately smoothed his expression.

"Busy," he said. "That's all." He reached for his outer jacket, pulling it on with practiced efficiency. "Come on. Walk me to the lift."

Jonah hesitated, then nodded. Alina groaned theatrically.

"You get to escort Papa," she said. "I get the Stabilizers."

"You get Ruth," Jonah said. "That's better."

Ruth snorted softly.

"We all get the Ship," she said. "And the Ship gets us. Best remember it goes both ways."

At the threshold, Samuel paused. The door panel light had shifted to a soft green, indicating corridor traffic was light. He laid his palm flat against the frame just as Ruth had against the wall.

"Keep us," he murmured. "We'll keep you."

Jonah's throat tightened at the simplicity of it. Before he could think better of it, he put his own hand beside his father's, fingers splayed over the metal. The bulkhead was cool and solid under his skin, hum steady.

He didn't say the words out loud. But he thought them, shaped them in the quiet space behind his ribs: Keep us. We'll keep you.

The panel chimed acknowledgment of their exit request. The door slid open on a corridor already alive with the low murmur of neighbors starting their own days. The same Ship, the same light, the same endless metal wrapped around them all.

Jonah stepped out with his father, ordinary morning settling over his shoulders like a familiar jacket. Later, there would be labs and indices and the sense of being looked through. Later, there would be doors that didn't open when you asked.

For now, there was this: the scrape of boots on deck, the smell of porridge on Samuel's sleeve, Ruth's whispered prayer clinging to the air.

For now, it held.
