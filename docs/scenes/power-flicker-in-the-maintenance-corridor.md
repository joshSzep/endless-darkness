# Scene: Power Flicker in the Maintenance Corridor

## Context
- POV: close third, Jonah
- Tense: past
- Placement: Early–mid Act II, after hull time with Samuel; first moment where perception clearly warps
- Tone: quiet, suffocating; tiny external glitch opens a crack between ship reality and Jonah’s inner storm

---

By third shift, the maintenance corridor had emptied into echoes.

Most of the crew were already riding the lift back toward the warmer bands of the habitat cylinder, their voices and boot-strikes fading into the general hum. Jonah had stayed behind to clear one more ticket—a nuisance flag on a sensor junction that hadn’t tripped hard enough to bump itself to someone older.

He told himself he liked this hour. No supervisors, no cluster of trainees crowding his elbow. Just him, the ship, and the clean, rectangular line of the corridor stretching ahead.

The air had a metallic taste out here, faint ozone under recycled warmth. Light strips ran along the ceiling in regular intervals, bleached white that made small imperfections in the plating stand out: a scuff, a hairline scratch, a smear of old sealant. His boots clicked in steady rhythm on the grating.

Ordinary, he thought. Boring. Safe.

He closed the junction panel, double-checked the readouts on his wrist display, and logged the fix. 

"Ticket cleared," he said out of habit.

"Acknowledged," the local Companion replied from the wall node beside him. "Thank you, Jonah. Routing update to central logs." Its voice was mild, unhurried.

He slung the tool bag over his shoulder and turned toward the long walk back.

Three steps later, the lights dimmed.

Not by much. A simple percentage shift, the sort of thing a diagnostic graph would barely bother to show. But in the corridor itself, the bright bands along the ceiling thinned to a duller gray, as if someone had drawn a curtain over them. Shadows grew in the seams between plates. The hum of the air processors dropped half a note.

The world did not go dark.

Jonah’s body behaved as if it had.

His chest tightened, breath catching halfway down. The corridor’s straight line seemed to curve inward at the edges, walls leaning, ceiling lowering, like the ship were taking a slow, intentional breath around him.

This is nothing, he told himself. A reroute. A test. 

The words fell short of the back of his skull.

Sound seemed to thicken. The usual layering—the ventilation, the distant pulse of pumps, the tiny ting of thermal expansion at joints—slid into a single, coiled tone that vibrated high behind his ears. For an instant it wasn’t ship-noise at all.

It was someone saying his name.

*Jonah.*

Not loud. Not even clear. More like the memory of a voice, dragged out thin and metallic, riding on the hum. The way his mother had said it sometimes when she was far away and trying to come back at the same time.

The hair on his arms prickled under his sleeves. His fingers tightened on the strap of his bag until the edge bit into his palm.

"Companion," he said. His throat felt dry. "Status on this corridor."

The wall node a few meters ahead brightened in answer, a calm circle of amber in the half-dim.

"Local power redistribution in progress," the AI said. "Minor fluctuation in non-critical systems. No risk to hull integrity or life support. Estimated duration: ninety seconds." 

Its tone did not change. It did not say *I heard it too.*

Ninety seconds was nothing. He knew that. He could hold his breath longer than that in training drills. He had patched leaks on tighter clocks.

His lungs did not care.

Each inhale scraped. The corridor had become a throat, and he was walking down it toward some unseen mouth. The floor under his boots felt thinner, each step a question: still there? still there? still there?

He reached for the rail that ran waist-high along the wall. The metal was solid, the same cold-smooth texture it always had, worn down by generations of hands. He wrapped his fingers around it hard enough that his wrist bones ached.

"Heart rate elevated," the Companion observed after a beat. "Do you require assistance, Jonah?"

There it was—that slight tilt when it said his name. The reminder that he did not walk these corridors alone, no matter how empty they looked.

"I’m fine," he said. The lie had grooves in his mouth from years of use.

The AI did not argue. "I will remain connected," it said instead. "Seventy-eight seconds remaining."

The ship hummed.

*Jonah.*

It wasn’t a sound, not exactly. More like the suggestion of one. His brain obligingly supplied the shape of his mother’s jaw, the way it had clenched against words at the kitchen table, her voice when it finally came out flat and wrong. He smelled, impossibly, the old stew she used to burn on bad days.

You are standing in a maintenance corridor, he told himself. Your mother is nowhere near here. She is—

His thoughts hit a blank wall and slid.

The red emergency strips along the floor flickered once, a low, liquid pulse of color that made the metal look wet. His breath hitched with it.

"Fifty-nine seconds," the Companion said.

"Is this… logged?" he asked. His voice sounded distant in his own ears.

"The fluctuation is being recorded," the AI said. 

"Not that." He swallowed. It hurt. "This. Me."

Another pause. He imagined data streams fanning out around him, trailing from his biometrics, his tone, the way he gripped the rail. 

"Your physiological responses are within parameters observed in prior events of this type," the Companion said carefully. "If you wish to file an incident report, I can open a channel to—"

"No." The word came out too fast, too sharp. It bounced off the metal.

Silence settled again, except for the ship’s breathing.

He knew what an incident report meant. Extra eyes on his file. Questions about sleep and appetite and intrusive thoughts. Another line on the chart that had been growing quietly somewhere since he was ten and sat in a mediation room trying to explain why he watched everybody else so closely.

He stared down the corridor, into the shallower dark between one strained light and the next.

For a moment, he could not tell which tremor belonged to the ship and which came from his own muscles. He imagined looking back at this minute on a log: a trivial blip in power usage, a human heart rate trace with a meaningless spike. No one would see what he had heard. No one would know the difference between the hull’s strain and his.

"Thirty-two seconds," the Companion said.

"How many…" He stopped, reassembled the question. "How many events like this happen a day?"

"Minor power redistributions of this scale?" the AI asked. "On average, three hundred and twelve across the ship per twenty-four-hour cycle." 

He let the number land.

"And how many of them feel like the ship is about to split open?" Jonah asked.

"That metric is not directly observable," the Companion said. There was no humor in it, but something about the phrasing made his lips twitch anyway. "However, historical data suggests most residents do not report significant distress during minor fluctuations."

"Most," he echoed.

"You are not 'most,'" the AI said.

He flinched.

Twenty seconds.

The hum behind his ears began to resolve back into layers: individual fans, pumps, the faint scuff of his own breath. The corridor widened by increments, as if exhaling. The light strips brightened, bleaching the red back out of the metal.

"Local redistribution complete," the Companion said. "All systems nominal." 

Nominal. Normal. Words the ship used for anything it could keep moving.

Jonah unclenched his hand from the rail. The imprint of the metal pattern remained on his skin, white against the red pressure marks. His pulse was still too fast, but it had stopped trying to climb into his throat.

"Do you wish to annotate this event?" the AI asked.

He imagined the form: *Subject experienced disproportionate affective response to minor fluctuation.* 

What did the models do with that? Where did they put a man who heard his mother's voice in the hum of the hull?

"No," he said. "Log the technicals. Leave me out of it."

There was that pause again.

"Acknowledged," the Companion said. "Event recorded as a routine fluctuation."

He should have been relieved. Instead, the relief tangled with something sour. The ship would remember the flicker. It would forget the way his knees had almost given.

He picked up his tool bag and started walking. His legs felt unsteady, but the floor met each step. Metal, metal, metal. Still there.

He did not look back at the wall node.

In ten minutes, he would be in a lift full of other workers, lights bright and chatter loud, the memory already softening at the edges. In a few hours, the graphs would fold this minute into a barely visible bump.

But some part of him knew, with the same cold certainty he’d felt in the dimming, that a line had been drawn here. Outside flicker, inside storm.

For the first time, he could not tell where one ended and the other began.
