### Concept
A young, sleepless Jonah hears the hull creak after a safety drill and can’t shake the feeling of thin metal between him and the void. Ruth sits with him in a darkened pod and teaches an adapted prayer: part old-Earth hymn, part plea for the hull, systems, AI, and family to "hold." She folds the AI into the prayer as one of the "hands" God uses, unsettling Jonah. He begins counting the rhythm of the prayer against the ticks and hums of the ship—a coping ritual that later echoes in his corridor panic scenes, binding faith, void-terror, and maintenance into one act.
