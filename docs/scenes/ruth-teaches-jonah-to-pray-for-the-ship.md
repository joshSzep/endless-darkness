The hull had kept creaking long after the drill ended.

During the alarm, everything had been loud in the right way: siren pulse, calm instructions over the speakers, the soft thud of neighbors’ feet as they moved to assigned spots. Jonah had stood between his father and his grandmother in the narrow corridor, feeling the vibration of the Ship’s voice through the wall.

"This is a drill," the Companion had said. "There is no current loss of pressure. Please follow standard protocol."

Now the lights were back to normal. The siren was off. People had gone home. The official threat level on the wall display had dropped back to its usual calm green.

The hull had not gotten the message.

Jonah lay on the narrow bunk in the Hales’ pod and watched the shadow of the vent grate on the ceiling. Every few heartbeats, a small metallic tick answered the Ship’s breathing: thermal expansion, Samuel had called it. Metal relaxing after stress.

It sounded like something cracking.

He pulled the thin blanket higher even though he wasn’t cold.

"You’re supposed to be asleep, little bird," a voice said softly from the doorway.

Jonah turned his head.

Ruth stood in the rectangle of dim corridor light, one hand braced on the jamb. She’d wrapped her hair in a worn scarf for the night, the pattern faded from years of washing. Behind her, the pod was a stack of darker shadows: Samuel’s bunk, the tiny table, the unit that held their water and air like a mechanical heart.

"Can’t," Jonah said.

"Can’t or won’t?" Ruth asked.

He opened his mouth to pick one, then closed it. The hull ticked again. He flinched.

Ruth’s eyes softened. She stepped inside and let the door slide shut behind her. The room shrank back to its own size, lit only by the narrow strip along the floor.

"Scoot over," she said.

He did. The bunk springs complained, but there was room enough for both if they kept close. Ruth sank down with a small sigh, bones and joints making their own quiet pops.

"Heard her creaking, did you?" she asked.

"She," Jonah repeated.

"The Ship," Ruth said. "You think of her as an "it" if you like. I’ve lived with her long enough to give her pronouns."

Jonah stared up at the ceiling again.

"What if she breaks?" he asked. The words tumbled out before he could stop them. "What if the drill’s wrong and one day it’s not a drill and the metal just…" He lifted a hand, fingers curving in the air. He didn’t have a word for what he meant. Coming apart. Letting go.

"Ah," Ruth said quietly.

The Ship hummed around them. Air through vents, water in pipes, some distant pump down the spine. Underneath it, the intermittent tick, tick as panels cooled.

"Come here," she said.

He scooted closer until his shoulder touched her side. She smelled like soap and the faint, lingering oil from Samuel’s hull harness—she’d helped him wipe it down earlier.

"You know what my mama used to do when the sky shook back on Earth?" Ruth asked.

"You had a sky," Jonah said. It came out half-accusation, half-wonder.

"We did," she said. "And storms. Big ones. Wind howling, rain on the roof so loud you couldn’t hear yourself think. When I was your size, I thought the whole house would rip up and blow away and we’d all go with it." She paused. "Your great-grandma would sit me down and pray out loud. Not because God forgot us when the clouds came, but because *I* did."

Jonah frowned. "You forgot God?"

"I forgot what held," Ruth said. "So she reminded me."

She settled her hand lightly over Jonah’s, where it clenched in the blanket.

"We don’t have a sky now," she went on. "We have steel and foam and clever folk who know their bolts from their beams. We have an AI watching numbers I can’t pronounce. That doesn’t make God smaller, Jonah. It just means we name more of His tools."

Jonah thought about the Companion voice from the drill, the one that came out of the wall without a face.

"The AI is…" He groped. "God’s tool?"

"One of them," Ruth said. "Same as your father’s hands. Same as these old bones when I get down on my knees." She squeezed his fingers once. "You want to pray with me?"

He hesitated.

Praying was something Samuel did before meals, words that slid past Jonah’s ears while he counted rivets or thought about lesson assignments. Lydia didn’t like it; she went still and tight-jawed when Samuel’s voice dipped, like the air had gotten thin.

But the hull kept ticking.

"Okay," he whispered.

Ruth shifted until they were both facing the ceiling.

"We’ll do it simple," she said. "Nothing fancy. You listen, and if you like the words, you can say them too."

She took a slow breath, the kind Samuel used when he was about to step out into the hull corridors.

"Lord," she said softly. "Hold the hull."

Jonah’s eyes went to the faint seam where two panels met above them.

"Hold the rings," Ruth continued. "Keep their spin true."

He pictured the diagrams from school: great circles turning, people glued to the inside by pretend gravity. If they slowed, everyone would feel it. If they stopped—

He swallowed.

"Hold the air in our lungs and the water in our pipes," Ruth said. "Hold Samuel when he walks the skin." Her hand tightened again on Jonah’s. "Hold Jonah when his mind runs faster than his bones."

Something fluttered in his chest at hearing his name there, tucked in with hull and rings.

"Hold the hands that hold the Ship," Ruth finished. "The welders and scrubbers, the watchers and worriers. And hold the mind that watches all this metal when we’re sleeping."

Jonah knew who she meant.

"The AI," he said quietly.

"Aye," Ruth said. "She’s no god. But if she’s doing her job, she’s one more way God keeps us from coming apart." She opened her eyes—he could feel the movement more than see it. "You want to try?"

He wet his lips.

"Lord," he said, the word strange and solid in his mouth. "Hold the hull."

The Ship hummed.

"Hold the rings," he went on. "Keep their…spin true."

Tick. Somewhere in the wall by his feet.

"Hold the hands that hold the Ship," he said, a little faster now, because the words seemed to fit together. "Dad, and the others, and…the AI that watches when we’re sleeping."

The last part felt odd, like putting two puzzle pieces together that hadn’t been in the same box. He pictured the Companion node above the door, its light ring dim. He tried to imagine God’s hand on that metal circle too.

"Amen," Ruth murmured.

Jonah let the word sit in his chest.

The hull ticked again. He matched it in his head: *hold*. Another tick: *rings*. The slow whoosh of the vent: *hands that hold the Ship*.

"You can count them, if it helps," Ruth said quietly, as if she’d read his mind. "Clicks and hums. Not to see if she’s failing, but to remember she’s working."

He nodded against the pillow.

They lay there in the dim, side by side, while the Ship made its small, honest sounds. Jonah counted between the noises, fitting Ruth’s words into the spaces.

Hold.

Rings.

Hands.

When his breathing finally slowed to match the vent, Ruth eased her hand free and brushed his hair back from his forehead.

"Sleep, little bird," she whispered.

The last thing he heard before he slid under was the faint, steady hum of systems doing exactly what they were meant to do, and the echo of his own voice praying for them to keep doing it.
