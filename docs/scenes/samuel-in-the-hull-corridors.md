The first thing Jonah noticed was the sound.

In the habitat bands, noise blurred together—voices, vents, distant rail hum, the background thrum of a world pretending to be whole. Here, in the hull corridors, the ship’s voice narrowed. It became a set of distinct notes: pump vibration through metal, faint tick of thermal expansion, the low, almost subsonic growl of reaction mass shifting somewhere far away.

Samuel clipped Jonah’s tether to the guide rail with a soft, practiced motion.

“Check it,” Samuel said.

Jonah tugged. The line went tight against his harness, then settled. The corridor around them was narrow enough that Samuel’s shoulders nearly brushed both walls. Anchor points studded the deck and ceiling like a second, smaller constellation.

“Suit seals?” Samuel asked.

“Green,” Jonah said.

“Mag soles?”

Jonah flexed his boots. They answered with a muted click as the field cycled.

“Good.” Samuel nodded once. “Stay on my left. If you feel lightheaded, you tell me before you lie to yourself about it.”

Jonah tried to smile. It came out thinner than he liked.

“I’m fine,” he said.

Samuel gave him a look—the quiet, assessing kind that meant he’d heard the word and the strain under it.

“You don’t have to impress me out here,” Samuel said. “The hull doesn’t care how brave you act. It only cares if you listen.”

He turned and started forward, boots clicking in slow, deliberate rhythm along the mag track. Jonah followed, tether line whispering against the guide rail.

The corridor curved gently with the ship’s hull. Overhead, bundles of cable and fluid lines ran in tight parallel, labeled with codes Jonah had half-memorized from training feeds. Every few meters, a service hatch broke the monotony: manual valves, inspection ports, an occasional view-port the size of Jonah’s hand, sealed over in thick, dark glass.

Beyond those ports, he knew, there was nothing.

Not sky, not air, not anything that would catch them if the metal gave way. Just the long, empty dark the old vids showed when they talked about pre-launch telescopes.

He did not look too long at the glass.

Samuel moved like the corridor was an old friend he trusted and still tested. His hand brushed each anchor point as they passed, a small tap Jonah had once thought was superstition.

“Is that for luck?” Jonah had asked, years ago, watching Samuel do the same thing before leaving for a shift.

Samuel had smiled then. “It’s for attention,” he’d said. “Reminds me there’s something between me and the dark, and it’s only as good as the last time somebody checked it.”

Now, walking beside him, Jonah saw the habit in context. Every tap was a question: still solid? still sealed? still holding?

“You can hear it better out here,” Samuel said.

“Hear what?”

“The ship.” Samuel stopped, head tilted slightly, one gloved hand pressed to the wall. “She talks different in the hull. When something’s wrong, it starts as… not a sound, exactly. A change in how all the other sounds fit together.”

Jonah paused too, unsure what he was supposed to be listening for. To him, the corridor hummed and ticked the way the training simulations had, only sharper, more real. Underneath it all was that faint, endless pressure: the knowledge of vacuum sitting just beyond layers of composite and alloy.

“Your Companion could chart it for you,” Samuel said, “but charts don’t give you instincts. Instincts keep you alive when you’re tired or scared.”

“Companions don’t get tired or scared,” Jonah said.

Samuel’s mouth twitched. “Exactly.”

They walked on.

After a while, the corridor narrowed further, forcing them into single file. The light strips along the floor dimmed for a moment as some distant system rebalanced load. Jonah’s breath stumbled, memory flashing to nursery rhymes about the dark outside: *Stay inside, hold the line, trust the shell to hold in time.*

The light steadied again. Samuel hadn’t even paused.

“You felt that?” he asked over his shoulder.

“Yeah.”

“Power shuffle in another sector,” Samuel said. “Nothing to do with us. But if it repeats, or lasts longer? That’s when you start asking questions.”

“Out loud?” Jonah asked. “Or to the AI?”

Samuel gave a soft huff that might have been a laugh.

“Both,” he said. “Preferably in that order.”

They reached a junction where three corridors met. A small alcove held a manual console, stripped-down and functional: pressure indicators, seal status, a fold-out display. A Companion icon pulsed faintly in the corner.

“Local node,” Samuel said. “Companion, status.”

The icon brightened, forming a simple voice-only interface.

“Section H-47C nominal,” the Companion said. “No current anomalies on this route. Hello, Samuel. Hello, Jonah.”

Jonah felt the familiar prickle at the base of his skull when it said his name. He wondered, crazily, if this local instance knew his stability score. If it could see that his heart rate had jumped when the lights dimmed.

“Morning,” Samuel said. “Log inspection start, route delta-seven.”

“Logged,” the Companion replied. “Exterior plate array F-19 indicates minor thermal stress variance within acceptable range. Recommend visual check if you are passing that point.”

“That’s where we’re headed,” Samuel said. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome,” the AI said, then dimmed itself back to background awareness.

Samuel glanced at Jonah. “Tools?”

Jonah patted the kit at his hip. “Check.”

“Good. Come on, then. Let’s go make sure ‘acceptable’ still means what it used to.”

They moved into the branch corridor. It felt even closer here, one side sloping inward where the outer hull thickened around a structural rib. Jonah’s mind insisted on drawing a cross-section: bodies, metal, then the thin gray line of vacuum beyond.

His palms were damp inside his gloves.

“Breathe,” Samuel said quietly, without looking back. “In for four. Hold for four. Out for six.”

Jonah obeyed before he could argue. The rhythm steadied his steps.

“You scared?” Samuel asked.

Jonah hesitated. He wanted to say no. He wanted to be the kind of son who walked these corridors with the same unbothered ease.

“A little,” he said instead.

Samuel nodded, as if that were the correct answer.

“Good,” he said. “Means you understand what’s outside. Fear’s not the enemy out here. Forgetting is.”

They stopped at a hatch marked with yellow bands. Samuel keyed in his authorization; the inner door cycled open to reveal a small lock chamber with another door at the far end.

“Not going outside today,” Samuel said, catching Jonah’s brief stiffening. “Just checking plate temps and mounts from inboard. Baby steps.”

Jonah swallowed. “Okay.”

Inside the lock chamber, Samuel connected a diagnostic lead from the console to a port by the hatch. A schematic bloomed on the small screen, lines and numbers Jonah followed with half-trained eyes.

“See that?” Samuel pointed to a cluster of readings tinted orange. “Thermal variance. Within spec, like the Companion said, but creeping. Metal gets tired same as people. You listen when it tells you.”

He rested his hand on the bulkhead again, fingers splayed.

“Same with people,” he added.

Jonah watched his father’s hand on the metal.

“What if it doesn’t tell you?” Jonah asked, before he could stop himself. “If it just… holds everything until it doesn’t?”

Samuel was quiet for a long moment. The only sound was the faint buzz of the console.

“Then you pay attention to the little things,” Samuel said. “Hairline cracks. Strange noises. Folks getting quieter instead of louder when they’re hurting.”

He looked at Jonah then, really looked, as if measuring more than vitals.

“You can’t fix everything,” Samuel said. “Not plates, not people. But you can stand where you’re meant to stand, and you can listen. That’s what trust looks like, to me.”

“Trust what?” Jonah asked.

Samuel shrugged one shoulder. “Materials. The people who checked them before you. The AI when it tells you something’s wrong. God, when there’s nothing else to lean on.”

He tapped the bulkhead twice, the same way he tapped anchor points.

“And yourself, eventually,” he added.

Jonah looked at the numbers again. The orange cluster sat there, contained but undeniable.

“What if I’m the part that fails?” Jonah asked, the words slipping out softer than he meant.

Samuel’s face didn’t change, but something in his posture did. He turned fully toward Jonah, hands loose at his sides.

“Then we patch,” Samuel said simply. “We brace. We take weight off that section until it can carry it again. Nobody throws the ship away because one plate needs attention.”

He let that sit for a beat.

“You’re not a single point of failure, son,” he said. “Not in this family. Not on this ship. You hear me?”

Jonah nodded, but the old fear still pressed at his ribs, tied to a kitchen chair and a mother who didn’t look up.

Samuel, as if guessing the direction of his thoughts, reached out and rested a hand on Jonah’s shoulder—not heavy, just steady.

“I know it’s loud in there sometimes,” he said. “I see it, even when you don’t say it. But loud doesn’t mean broken. It just means we pay attention.”

He squeezed once, then released.

“Now,” he said, practical again, “tell me what you’d recommend for this variance if it shows up on your board, three shifts from now, when I’m not standing next to you.”

Jonah forced his mind back to the schematic. He traced heat paths, thought through material tolerances, imagined the worst case the way his training urged and his anxiety excelled at.

“Flag it for monitoring,” he said slowly. “Schedule a closer inspection. Maybe rotate load away from this section if the model says it’s cheap enough.”

“And if the AI says the model doesn’t justify it?” Samuel asked.

Jonah hesitated. “Then I… accept the risk?”

Samuel shook his head, half-smiling.

“Then you ask again,” he said. “You give it better data, better questions. You don’t bully it and you don’t worship it. You work with it. Same as any partner.”

He turned back to the console, fingers moving with practiced care.

“Faith’s like that too,” he added, almost as an afterthought. “You don’t get all the answers you want. You just keep bringing what you have, and you keep listening for what’s real.”

They finished the checks in small, absorbing steps—tightening a fastener here, logging a minor discrepancy there. Outside, unseen, the dark pressed evenly against the hull. Inside, the ship hummed and breathed and carried them all forward.

On the way back, Jonah found his steps matching Samuel’s rhythm without thinking. Tap, tap, tap on the anchor points; breathe in for four, hold for four, out for six.

He was still afraid.

But walking there, tether linked to his father and his boots holding firm to the track, he felt something else layered over the fear: a sense that the thin metal between them and the dark was not the only thing keeping him from falling.

Samuel glanced over, as if he could see that shift on Jonah’s face.

“Not so bad, is it?” he asked.

Jonah looked down the long, narrow corridor, then up at the maze of lines and plates that made their world possible.

“No,” he said. “Not so bad.”

He didn’t add: *As long as you’re here.*

He didn’t have to. Samuel seemed to hear it anyway.
