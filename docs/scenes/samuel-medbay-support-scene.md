Samuel had always thought of Medbay as a place for broken bodies, not broken storms.

On hull shifts, if you got careless or unlucky, there were clear markers: gashes, fractures, bruises staining through the underlayer. Something visible to point at while the Companions recited protocols and the med techs sealed you up.

Now he sat in a chair beside Jonah’s bed and watched the outlines of his son under the thin blanket. No blood, no cast. Just a tangle of leads across his chest and the soft hiss of a monitor watching what no human eye could see.

The Ship hummed through the walls. It had the same note as the hull corridors, but here it was filtered—gentler, as if someone had closed a door on the real sound.

"Vitals stable," the Companion said quietly from the wall. "Sedation tapering as scheduled."

Samuel nodded without looking up at the status strip. "I can see he’s breathing," he said. "Thank you."

He didn’t add: *I trusted you to keep him breathing before today, too.*


Jonah’s face, in sleep, looked younger than it had in years. Less pulled tight by constant calculation. There were faint creases at the corners of his eyes now—early, given his age—but when he was like this, Samuel could almost see the boy who had crawled into his lap after the first big drill, shaking from hull ticks.

Ruth had taken that night. Samuel had been on an early shift; by the time he’d come home, Jonah had been curled under his grandmother’s arm, learning to pray the Ship still. The memory brushed against him now like the echo of a hymn.

"You’re missing a good story, kid," he said softly, leaning back in the chair until it creaked.

Jonah did not stir.

The monitor drew another small mountain range of his heart on the strip.


"You may speak," the Companion said. "He is within hearing range, even under sedation."

"If I thought you were listening harder than he is, I might choose my words different," Samuel said.

There was a brief pause from the wall.

"Our audio channels are active," it said at last. "But this unit is not authorized for deactivation review commentary."

"I’m not here to argue with a committee," Samuel said. "I’m here to sit with my boy."

He imagined, for a moment, Jonah waking to that phrase—*my boy*—and rolling his eyes. You didn’t call a grown engineer that without protest. Samuel smiled to himself and let the thought stay.


He cleared his throat.

"You remember," he said, as if Jonah could answer, "how you used to count the hull ticks after drills?" He waited a beat. "Ruth taught you that. I’d hear you some nights, whispering numbers in your bunk like you were keeping score against the dark."

The monitor beeped, indifferent.

"She did that as a girl back on Earth," he went on. "Storms there came loud. Wind howling, rain slamming roofs, thunder like the Ship tearing in half. She’d lie there and count between flashes, between rumbles. Say if she could count high enough before the next one, it meant the storm was moving away."

He folded his hands, thumb worrying at the callus on his palm that never quite went away between hull shifts.

"It didn’t change the storm," he said. "Just gave her something to hold while it passed."


Jonah shifted under the blanket, a small movement, his fingers twitching once against the sheet.

Samuel leaned forward.

"You think…" he said slowly, searching for words that would not sound like a sermon, "you think you were supposed to be the one holding the storm off all by yourself. Lydia’s, yours, maybe even the Ship’s. Like if you stopped watching, stopped counting, stopped fixing, it would all come down."

He let that sit in the air between them.

"You’re not built for that," he said. "None of us are. Not even the metal is, not on its own. We weld in layers. We overlap plates. We don’t ask one strip of hull to take the whole void."

The Companion made a small adjustment noise—some background process rebalancing.

"Your mother," he said, and the word caught in his throat more than he’d expected, "she thought she had to carry storms too. Hers were quieter on the outside. But inside…" He exhaled. "Inside, they tore her up."

He had not talked about Lydia much with Jonah. Not like this. The stories Jonah carried were mostly secondhand through Ruth, softened by prayer.

"You know how she died," he said, voice low. "You don’t know…you couldn’t know all the nights before that. The sitting up while you and Alina slept, staring at the ceiling like if she blinked, the Ship would stop."

The Companion’s light dimmed a fraction, as if respecting volume.

"I loved her," he said simply. "The way you love the Ship. Fiercely. Foolishly, sometimes. Thought if I held on tight enough, I could keep her here." He shook his head. "Turns out loving someone isn’t the same as fixing them."


Jonah’s breathing hitched once, then settled.

"I watched you grow up with that same look in your eyes," Samuel said. "Always reading panels in your head, carrying everyone’s numbers. Ruth used to say you’d make a good engineer because you cared so much. She wasn’t wrong." He smiled faintly. "She also worried that caring would tear you up where we couldn’t see."

He reached out and laid his hand gently over Jonah’s, careful of the IV line.

"Listen to me, son," he said, voice firming. "You are not your indices. Not your risk scores, not your logs, not whatever graphs they showed you today. Those are tools. They help the Ship keep people breathing. They do not get to name you."

The word *name* stirred something deep in him, tied to an older cadence.

"The name I gave you when you came squalling into this world was Jonah," he said. "Not Outlier. Not Deviation. Jonah Hale. You belong to this family, to this Ship, to the God your grandmother talks to when she lays her hand on the wall. None of that is erased because you had a bad day in the gardens."

He squeezed Jonah’s fingers once.

"You broke a pipe," he said. "You scared yourself and some good people we work with. That’s real. We’ll fix what we can and carry what we can’t. But you did not break the Ship. You did not break us."


He sat back, letting his hand rest until his fingers went a little numb.

"They’ll take you into that room soon," he said, more to himself than to Jonah. "Ask questions. Show you stills, graphs, every mistake like it’s the whole story." He breathed in slow through his nose, feeling the medbay air, scrubbed and dry. "When they’re done, when the Ship and its committees have had their say, you come home. We’ll tell you other stories. About your mother that aren’t just about leaving. About you that aren’t just about breaking."

He glanced up at the status strip.

"You hear that?" he said quietly to the Companion. "That’s my input for your model. Put it somewhere." He tapped his chest. "Man is more than the sum of his metrics."

"Quote recorded," the Companion said after a moment. "Sentiment tagged as non-clinical, high relevance to subject support."

Samuel huffed a breath that might almost have been a laugh.

"Good," he said. "Maybe one day when you’re drawing one of your little mountains for him, you remember it too."


He stayed until the sedation wore thin enough that Jonah’s eyes fluttered at the edges. Not fully awake; just surfacing toward the sound of his father’s voice.

Samuel leaned close.

"I’m here," he said.

Jonah’s lips moved around a half-word he could not catch.

"You rest now," Samuel told him. "You don’t have to hold the hull tonight. The Ship’s got that job. So do I. So does every poor tired soul walking the rings."

He felt, under his hand, the faintest answering pressure from Jonah’s fingers.

For the first time since the incident, Samuel let himself believe that might be enough.
