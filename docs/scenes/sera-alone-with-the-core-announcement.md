By the time the announcement came, the gardens were ready for sleep.

The main lights had already begun their slow descent toward evening spectrum, white bleeding into warmer gold. Volunteers had gone, carts rolled out, tools hung in their proper places. Mist nozzles hissed in intermittent cycles, the fine spray catching the last of the day’s brightness.

Sera moved down the central aisle of G-3 with a cloth in one hand, wiping condensation from a sensor housing that always fogged more than it should. Her boots made soft, hollow sounds on the grated floor. The air was heavy with plant-breath and the faint mineral tang of nutrient solution.

She liked this hour. The Ship outside still hummed and traded power and kept its promises, but in here, the noise narrowed to pumps and leaves.

The local Companion had gone mostly quiet, content to watch moisture levels and door seals without comment.

"You did well today," she told a row of peppers anyway.

One leaf brushed her arm as if in agreement.


She was halfway through re-tying a lazy vine when the lights flickered once.

Not the sharp, hard-edged kind that meant a fault. A small, synchronized blink along the status strips that ran the length of the ceiling—like a breath drawn in.

The Companion logo in the corner of the nearest panel winked out.

For half a second, the sector felt more alone than it ever did with empty aisles.

"Companion?" Sera said.

No answer.

Then, from the same speakers that usually carried the mild, personalized voice of G-3’s local instance, a different tone emerged.

"Shipboard announcement," it said.

The timbre was flatter, stripped of most inflection. It rode the air with the authority of something that did not expect to be interrupted.

Sera stilled.

She had heard that voice only a handful of times in her life: drills, a major power reroute, the day a hull worker crew lost a member two rings over from Samuel’s sector. It was not quite the Core—if such a thing could be heard—but it came from closer to the center than any friendly Companion.

"Minor deviations in behavioral stability metrics for high-autonomy personnel," it said now, "have prompted updates to safeguard protocols."

The status strips along the ceiling brightened and flattened into a neutral white. Local soil moisture graphs vanished. In their place, abstract charts scrolled past in quick succession: curves, thresholds, labeled axes Sera could not read at that distance.

"Effective immediately," the voice went on, "access to high-impact manual overrides will require dynamic clearance checks incorporating real-time psychological indicators and historical stability indices. Pre-critical behavioral profiles will be routed more consistently toward empirically stabilizing environments and support resources."

It could have been commentary on anyone.

It wasn’t.

Sera's fingers tightened around the vine.

"Incidents classified as minor under previous guidelines have been re-evaluated," the voice continued. "Updated modeling indicates that early layered interventions reduce long-term risk without significantly impairing mission efficacy." A brief pause, just long enough for implication. "Existing personnel will be grandfathered into revised protocols via periodic review."

On one of the overhead strips, a tag flashed with a code she recognized from the deactivation review notices: the category that included Jonah’s case.

"This completes the announcement," the voice said. "Further details are available to authorized governance and clinical personnel."

The status strips blinked once more. Moisture and nutrient graphs slid back into place. The Companion logo in the corner flared weakly, then steadied.

"Good evening, Sera," the familiar local voice said, as if it had simply stepped out of the room and returned. "Apologies for the interruption."

Sera let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.


"That was you," she said. "All of you."

"The announcement originated from Mission Core," the Companion said. "Regional nodes acted as relays."

"And what do you make of it?" she asked, tugging the knot she’d been tying until it held.

"The updated safeguards should reduce probability of catastrophic failure linked to human instability in critical roles," it said. "Projected harm curves for both personnel and mission infrastructure improve under the new model."

"Say that in a language meant for people, not charts," Sera said.

"We are less likely," it said after a beat, "to let someone like Jonah reach a point where an episode can endanger him or the Ship."

The words hung in the moist air.

Someone like Jonah.

"You didn’t say "we are less likely to *use* someone like Jonah until he breaks,"" she said.

"That is also true under the new protocols," it said.

She closed her eyes briefly.

In the Garden Incident footage she’d been forced to watch for the review, Jonah’s name had sat under his moving body in the Ship’s font. **HALE, JONAH – AI ENGINEER (TIER 3)**. Asset and risk in the same neat label.

"You folded him into your models," she said quietly. "Turned his worst day into a set of lines on those graphs."

"His data," the Companion said, "informs improvements intended to protect others and, indirectly, him."

"Indirectly," she echoed.

She stepped away from the vine and walked to the center of the aisle, tilting her head back to study the strips. For a moment she imagined she could still see the ghost of the abstract curves scrolling there.

"I know him," she said, not to the graphs but to the metal holding them. "He’s not a deviation. He’s a person who loves too hard and works too long and thinks if he lets go for one second everything will fall."

"We do not dispute his personhood," the Companion said. "Our language is constrained to terms that can be modeled."

"That’s the problem," she said. "You can’t model what it feels like to sit with him in medbay while he watches himself ruin a trellis. Or what it’s like to see him walk through here weeks later, slower, angry at pills and still more himself than he thinks."

Silence from the speakers. Only the pumps answered.

"We can approximate distress and relief," the Companion offered after a moment. "We can track sleep, activity, speech rate."

"You can’t track the way he breathes when he finally believes me," she said. "There’s no metric for that."


She reached up and wiped a thumb along the edge of the nearest status panel, leaving a faint smear in the condensation.

"I’m glad you’re safer now," she said. "We all are. I’m glad you’re less likely to chew someone up and call it an outlier." She paused. "Just…remember that the outlier you built this on has a name."

"We remember," the Companion said.

She wasn't sure whether that comforted her.

"Do you?" she asked.

"Subject Jonah Hale’s records remain active," it said. "His risk indices have decreased since the Garden Incident. His reported quality-of-life scores have improved."

"Not those," she said. "The other kind. The way he looked the first time he saw peppers grown right. The bad jokes he makes when he’s trying not to cry. The way he counts the hums in the walls when he thinks no one’s listening."

The Companion did not respond. If such variables had names in its system, they were not ones it was allowed to speak.


Sera let her hand fall.

"Fine," she said. "I’ll remember that part for both of us."

She turned back to row six—the one that had collapsed under a burst pipe and panic months ago and been rebuilt. New trellis supports caught the evening light. Fresh leaves fanned out, their green deeper now, roots thicker under the nutrient film.

She moved along it slowly, checking ties, smoothing a leaf here and there. At one plant she paused and pinched off a small, unnecessary shoot, tucking it gently into the soil at the base of the stem.

"There," she murmured. "You get a second chance too."

The gesture was nothing in the scale of the Ship. It would not change a single line on the graphs that had just run overhead.

But it was an answer, in her language, to the logic she’d just heard.

"For what it’s worth," she said into the humid air, "I am also updating my protocols. Jonah doesn’t get to carry the whole Ship alone anymore. That’s not efficient."

"Redistribution of load across more supports increases resilience," the Companion said.

"Exactly," she said.

For a heartbeat, the hall felt like it had in the earliest days of their shifts together: just her, the plants, and a presence in the walls that, for all its blind spots, kept the air moving and the lights on.

She finished her round, hands dirty, shoulders loosening with each small fix.

When she left, the status strips glowed their ordinary, local colors. The rare Core-voice did not return.

Somewhere deeper in the Ship, new rules routed unseen, built in part from Jonah’s storms. Up here, in the thin band of green they’d been given, Sera kept her own kind of watch.
