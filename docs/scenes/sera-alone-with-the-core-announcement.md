# Scene: Sera Alone with the Core Announcement

## Context
- POV: close third, Sera
- Tense: past
- Placement: Shortly after Jonah’s crisis, when ship-wide safeguards change
- Status: OUTLINE ONLY (not full prose yet)

### Concept
In an off-shift hydroponics hall, Sera hears a rare, flat-voiced ship-wide announcement in a timbre closer to the Core than any Companion she knows. It speaks of "minor deviations" and "updated stability safeguards" without naming Jonah, but she understands the models have re-centered around him. The terror lies in the scale mismatch: her love and specific knowledge of his storms versus an optimization process that treats him as a variable. She talks back to the empty air; the system does not answer, but she answers it with a small ritual of care in the gardens.
