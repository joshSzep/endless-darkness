By the end of third shift, the gardens were running on inertia.

The main volunteers had gone; carts were stacked neatly in their bays, tools magnet-clipped to the wall. Misters hissed on their timed cycle, threading fine droplets through the leaves. The status strips along the ceiling glowed a contented green.

Sera moved down row four with a cloth in one hand, wiping moisture from a sensor housing that always fogged more than it should. Her shoulders ached in the dull, familiar way that meant she would sleep tonight if her brain allowed it.

"Last pass," she told the peppers.

One leaf brushed her wrist as if acknowledging the deal.

The sector door cycled open with a soft hiss.

She didn’t have to turn to know who it was; the way the air changed around him had become its own signature. A small hitch in the Companion’s light ring. A shift in the hum she’d only started noticing since the intervention.

"You’re off rotation," she said, finishing the wipe before looking up.

Jonah stood just inside the threshold, hands in his jacket pockets, eyes doing a slow sweep of the rows as if he were checking for stress fractures instead of aphids. He wore the tired, overstretched look of someone who had come off a different kind of shift and hadn’t known where else to go.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi," she said.

The local Companion chimed softly.

"Unscheduled presence: Jonah Hale," it said. "Access level: permitted. Behavioral context:—"

"Stop," Sera said, sharper than she meant to.

The light ring over the node flickered once.

"Annotation suppressed," it said. "Logging continues."

"Of course it does," Jonah muttered.

He pushed his hands deeper into his pockets as he stepped between the first two rows. His boots made almost no sound on the grated floor; he walked like someone expecting the deck to shift under him at any moment.

"I can come back during scheduled hours," he said. "If this is—"

"It’s fine," she said, less sharp now. "You’re not a contaminant. You’re just…here." She nodded toward the row. "Come on. Might as well make yourself useful if you’re going to haunt my peppers."

He huffed something that might have been a laugh and fell into step beside her, hands finally emerging to take the spare cloth she held out.

They moved in parallel for a few minutes, checking ties, smoothing leaves, wiping condensation from housings. The work was small, repetitive, blessedly concrete.

"How was the node?" she asked.

"Loud," he said. "Even when it was quiet." He shrugged one shoulder. "The usual."

The usual now included "micro" wellness surveys and pre-critical trending, though he hadn’t said the last part aloud yet. She could see it in the way his jaw tightened whenever the Companions used certain words.

"Any heroics?" she asked lightly.

"No pipes died in my presence," he said. "Small victories."

She let the joke hang for a beat before she risked the next question.

"Did you come to see me," she asked, "or to see them?" She flicked her gaze along the rows.

"Is "both" allowed?" he asked.

"Honest answer, please," she said.

He wiped at a perfectly clean sensor, cloth sliding in small, unnecessary circles.

"I came because it’s quiet," he said. "And because when it’s quiet in my room, my head gets…loud. Here it’s noisy in the right ways. Pumps. Leaves. People who talk about root depth instead of indices." He risked a glance at her. "And because you’re here."

Warmth and warning rose together in her chest.

"Jonah," she said.

"I know," he said quickly. "I know you’re not a therapist. Or a nurse. Or whatever title they slap on the people who hand out stabilizers." He wiped too hard, almost knocking the sensor askew, and corrected it with careful fingers. "You’re just the only place the Ship caught me before I broke something." He swallowed. "It’s…hard not to associate that with safety."

She let the cloth hang from her hand, watching his shoulders instead of his face.

"You’re allowed to feel safer here," she said. "You’re allowed to like being around me." She took a breath. "You are not allowed to make me the only thing between you and the void."

He flinched as if she’d slapped him.

"I didn’t—" he started.

"You did," she said, gentler. "Not on purpose. But you walk in here with that look"—she gestured vaguely at his eyes—"like if I’m not at this bench, at this row, you’re going to float off the edge."

The Companion stayed wisely silent.

"Ruth prayed for the hull," she went on, voice softer. "You know that. She also taught me that faith without other hands on the metal is just wishful thinking. I am one pair of hands. The Ship has others. So do you."

He stared at the leaf in front of him as if it contained an equation he couldn’t solve.

"Who?" he asked. "Besides you. And the AI that keeps drawing little mountains with my name on them."

"Samuel," she said. "Alina. Ruth. The poor trainees you keep from electrocuting themselves." She nudged his elbow. "And yes, the AI. Even if you hate how it talks."

"It doesn’t talk," he said. "It labels."

"Sometimes labels are the only reason someone gets pulled off a bad shift," she said. "Sometimes they’re a cage. Both can be true." She met his eyes. "What I cannot be is your only release valve. If you’re using me, or this place, instead of meds or counseling or sleep, that’s not fair to either of us."

He looked away first.

"They’re already watching me," he said, quiet. "Every breath, every step. Coming here feels like…choosing something. Instead of just being routed."

"I like that you choose here," she said. "I like that you choose me." The admission cost her something and gave her something back at the same time. "But if the choice is between you resenting the Ship in my sector or resenting me when I can’t hold you together, I’d rather you yell at a Companion in medbay."

He laughed once, sharp and joyless.

"You think I’d resent you?" he asked.

"If you start to believe I failed you," she said. "If something goes wrong and I’m not where you need me to be. That’s how those stories go. "She was my anchor until she wasn’t."" She shook her head. "I won’t sign up to be your only story like that."

He leaned both hands on the trellis, knuckles whitening.

"What do you want me to do?" he asked. "Stop coming?"

"No," she said immediately. "I want you to come because you’re on the schedule, or because you want to see the peppers, or because you had a good day and need to brag about your neat little code fixes." Her mouth twitched. "I want you to come when you’re having a bad day too. I just want that to be one line in a bigger plan. Not the whole plan."

He was quiet for a long moment.

"What if I don’t have a bigger plan yet?" he asked.

"Then we make one," she said. "With people whose literal job it is to build them. And I help where I can without pretending I’m the whole scaffolding." She tilted her head. "Have you actually answered any of the counseling pings?"

He grimaced.

"Define "answered,"" he said.

"Jonah," she said.

"Once," he admitted. "Years ago. It was…" He made a helpless gesture. "They asked polite questions. I gave polite answers. The graphs got more colorful, I assume."

"Try again," she said. "This time with the knowledge that you’re not trying to prove you’re fine. You’re trying to not end up on a floor surrounded by broken pipes."

He winced.

"Too soon," he said.

"Not for me," she said. "I’m the one who has to mop up when that happens." 

He let out a breath that could have been a laugh or a sob.

"You’re serious about this," he said.

"Very," she said. "I care about you enough to not want to be your entire risk-mitigation strategy."

The Companion chose that moment to chime.

"Peer-set boundaries are correlated with improved long-term outcomes," it said.

Sera closed her eyes briefly.

"Not helping," she told the node.

"Acknowledged," it said.

Jonah’s shoulders had dropped by a fraction. When he spoke again, his voice was rough.

"If I make an appointment," he said, "will you…"

"Go with you?" she finished. "If you want. I can sit in the waiting room and complain about their tea."

"They always have bad tea," he said.

"Then I’ll bring my own," she said.

He nodded once, as if committing to a risk calculation.

"Okay," he said. "I’ll try." He glanced down the row. "Can I still wipe sensors when it’s on the schedule?"

"Yes," she said. "You’re very good at wiping sensors. Terrible at pretending you’re fine. We can work with both."

This time the laugh that escaped him was small but real.

"Deal," he said.

They fell back into motion, cloths moving, hands busy. The gardens hummed around them, indifferent and generous.

Sera knew the conversation would not magically fix anything. There would be more arguments, more days when he showed up with that look, more hums in pipes that his brain would hear as omens. The Ship would keep drawing its graphs; she would keep tending her rows.

But for tonight, she had said the thing that needed saying: I love you, and I refuse to be the only wall you lean on, especially the next time something in a main line feels "off" and his hands itch for a valve.

It would have to be enough.
