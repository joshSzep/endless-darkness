The hall never quite stopped moving.

Not enough to make anyone sick—just a slow, almost-imperceptible sway that came from being too close to the rotational midline. The designers had done their best: wide floor, low seats bolted in gentle arcs, a ceiling curved to suggest shelter instead of machinery. But when Jonah sat still, he could feel his weight shift by degrees, as if the whole room were breathing around him.

Samuel liked this hall. Said it felt honest.

"You remember you're in a ship here," he’d told Jonah once, after a midweek service. "Some places, they try too hard to pretend it's a planet."

Now they sat near the middle, not too close to the front, not so far back that it felt like hiding. Jonah rested his hands on his knees and watched the railings along the side walls slide half a centimeter left, then right, with each slow adjustment of the ship’s rotation. The movement wasn't real—not in the way his mind registered it. It came from the tiny muscle corrections his body made to stay balanced, signals that his brain converted into the sense that the world was tilting under him.

Better to focus on that than on the words.

The elder at the front—a narrow man with a lined face and a voice that carried without strain—was deep into the story of Tau Ceti again. The familiar imagery rippled through the hall: the star as a "waiting light," the ship as an "ark in exile," the generations as "keepers of the flame." Panels along the back wall showed a stylized white point in a black field, flaring slightly every time he said the name.

"Our fathers and mothers boarded this vessel," he said, "not to escape judgment, but to carry the promise forward. Through darkness, through silence, through the loneliness of steel and distance, they held fast. And we—" he spread his hands, letting his gaze move across the crowd "—we are the proof that their faith was not in vain."

Murmurs of assent rose and fell. Jonah felt Samuel shift slightly beside him, nodding once.

Jonah counted the exposed rivets along the nearest support pillar. Sixteen on the visible side. Probably thirty-two total. Two for each mounting bracket, four brackets per beam. It was easier to think about load distribution than about "promise."

"We are not the first to feel the strain of this journey," the elder went on. "We are not the first to fear we will not make it. Some of our number, over the centuries, have…" He paused, choosing the word. "Broken."

There it was.

The word hung in the air like a dropped tool. No one flinched—at least not outwardly. The hall knew this part by heart. It was in every catechism, every history feed, every whispered caution.

"We remember them not to shame," the elder said, "but to warn. The Ones Who Broke under the burden of the Mission. Those who turned inward, who let despair swallow their duty. They remind us that we are fragile. That without each other, without the guidance of the Mission and the care of the Ship, we are lost."

Jonah stared at the floor.

He could feel Samuel’s attention sharpen, the way it always did when the sermon steered toward pain. His father's hands folded more tightly; the knuckles whitened, then eased. Jonah knew, without looking, that Samuel’s eyes would be on the elder’s face the way he watched strain gauges in the hull—measuring, testing for truth.

Across the aisle, near the back wall, a woman in green coveralls leaned against a standing rail. Her sleeves were rolled up to the elbow, forearms dusted with a faint film of dried nutrient solution. Hydroponics worker, Jonah guessed—one of the hundreds who spent their days in the grow corridors. Her hair was tied back in a loose knot, damp at the edges as if she’d barely had time to wash before coming here.

She wasn’t watching the elder.

Her gaze moved over the crowd, resting for a moment on each cluster: a family with three small children fidgeting in their seats, an older couple with their fingers intertwined, a knot of teenagers whispering into their shared display. Her expression stayed neutral, curious rather than reverent, like someone studying a system she’d been asked to maintain.

Jonah dropped his eyes before she could turn in his direction.

"The Ship keeps watch over us," the elder said. "Not as a tyrant, but as a guardian. Its intelligence, gifted by those who came before, sees what we cannot—predictions, patterns, risks. When the Ship speaks, when it warns, we must listen. For it is not only steel and silicon; it is the memory of the Mission itself."

The hall’s ambient speakers pulsed with his voice. Somewhere behind the walls, Companion instances relayed the sound, corrected for echo, filtered for clarity. Jonah wondered, briefly, if any of them were listening the way the humans were, weighing his words.

He knew the lines about guardianship. He’d memorized them in classes, heard them in a hundred variations from Samuel and Ruth and the others. He didn’t disagree, exactly. The Ship did see things people missed. It kept air flowing and wheels turning and collisions at bay.

It also kept Behavioral Stability Logs.

"But," the elder added, and the word cut cleanly through the reverent murmur, "we do not worship the Ship. We do not bow to the Machine. We partner. We submit our fears, our doubts, our storms to something greater—not cold calculation, but the One who called us into this journey."

Soft "amen"s rippled around Jonah. Samuel’s voice joined them, low and sure.

Jonah’s did not.

He pressed his thumbs together, nail into nail, until a small point of pain steadied his breath. He believed that Samuel believed. He even wanted to believe in whatever made his father able to sit here talking about broken people without falling apart himself.

But when the elder spoke about "storms" and "submission," Jonah didn’t picture God.

He pictured his mother at the kitchen table, staring through him. He pictured the gentle tone of a Companion asking him, at eight, at nine, at ten, whether he’d been sleeping, whether he sometimes felt very sad or very high for no reason. He pictured a file with his name on it, somewhere in the data vaults, growing line by line.

"We are not defined by those who broke," the elder said. "We are defined by the One who holds us together. By the covenants we keep. By the hands that hold us when we cannot hold ourselves."

Jonah risked a glance sideways.

Samuel’s eyes were damp. Not weeping, just bright, as if some old pain had been acknowledged and not dismissed. When he noticed Jonah looking, he gave a small, almost embarrassed half-smile, the kind that said: yes, this hurts, yes, I’m still here.

Across the aisle, the woman in green—Sera, though Jonah didn’t yet know her name—shifted her weight, the faint motion of someone whose back had started to ache. She uncrossed her arms, letting her hands rest lightly on the rail in front of her. When the elder mentioned "The Ones Who Broke" again, her gaze flicked, not to the front, but toward a cluster of older women sitting alone near the side wall. Her face softened, then closed, as if she’d seen this story land on them too many times.

The sermon moved toward its end: a prayer for endurance, for continued guidance, for steady hands in the hull and in the gardens and at the control stations. People rose when prompted, some eagerly, some out of habit. Jonah stood because Samuel did, because standing was easier than sitting with the weight in his chest.

"Lead us," the elder intoned, "through darkness that has no stars."

The hall swayed, just a little.

Jonah closed his eyes and felt the ship’s long, slow spin tug at his bones. He imagined, for a brief, dizzy second, that if the rotation stopped they would all lift together—chairs, rails, preacher, father, hydroponics worker—hang in the air, and then drift outward until metal and bodies and breath scattered into the endless dark.

When he opened his eyes again, everything was still in its place. The Ship hummed. The congregation began to disperse.

Samuel touched his shoulder. "You all right?" he asked quietly.

"Yeah," Jonah said. "Just…felt it move."

Samuel chuckled under his breath. "That’s how you know it’s working."

They stepped into the aisle. As they moved toward the exit, Jonah kept his gaze on the floor, watching boots and shoes shuffle past. For an instant, as the flow of people narrowed near the doors, he found himself shoulder to shoulder with the woman in green.

Up close, he noticed the faint smell of damp leaves and nutrient solution clinging to her skin, the kind of clean, earthy scent that didn’t exist anywhere else on the ship. She glanced at him—just a quick, assessing look, the way you’d look at a curious plant or a misaligned pipe—then offered a small nod before the crowd pulled them in different directions.

Jonah filed the moment away without quite knowing why.

Later, when he thought about the first time he and Sera shared a room, he wouldn’t remember the sermon. He’d remember the feeling of the hall tilting around him, Samuel’s steady hand on his shoulder, and the brief brush of her presence in the doorway, like a new current in air he’d thought was still.
