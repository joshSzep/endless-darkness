# Scene: Shift-Change Bench – Jonah and Sera

## Context
- POV: close third, Jonah
- Tense: past
- Placement: Act II, after `first-shared-shift-in-the-gardens.md` and before heavier evaluation/unraveling beats
- Tone: quiet, ordinary, gently warm; connection built in small, off-duty overlap rather than crisis

The bench outside hydroponics was technically not a bench.

It was a stretch of reinforced conduit casing that happened to sit under a bank of status strips, at exactly the right height for tired workers to drop onto while they waited for the lift. Someone had added a strip of foam padding a few cycles back, taped in place with the kind of determination that told Jonah this was no longer an accident of architecture. The Ship had grown a bench whether it wanted to or not.

He sat on the left end, back to the cool metal of the wall, fingers loosely wrapped around a cup of lukewarm tea.

Third shift in G-3 had just ended. The corridor outside the sector door was in that brief overlap between teams: gardeners and stewards peeling off, other workers in gray and blue streaming past on their own routes. A faint mist still clung to Sera’s sleeves from the last cycle of the misters; droplets caught the light like they were reluctant to leave.

"You’re making that face again," she said, dropping onto the right end of the bench with a small sigh.

"Which face?" he asked.

"The one that says you’re analyzing the status lights for fun instead of talking to a person," she said.

He looked up at the strips out of reflex. Moisture levels, nutrient flow, a band of soft green across the top that meant everything inside was within tolerance. He’d already noticed the minor oscillation in loop D; it was within margin. He dragged his gaze back down.

"They’re very soothing," he said. "Stable graphs. No one yelling."

"You're allowed to like two things at once," Sera said. She set her own cup down between her knees. Steam had mostly given up. "Lights and human company. It's not an either-or situation."

"For some of us it feels like a resource conflict," he said.

A corner of her mouth twitched.

"You say that like a man whose brain is running too many processes," she said.

"Pot, kettle," he said.

They sat in companionable silence for a few breaths. The corridor hum filled in around them: distant lift chimes, the murmur of voices, the faint hiss of the sector door cycling open and shut as volunteers trickled out.

"You hear it, then," she said, after a while.

"Hear what?" he asked.

"The Ship," she said. "You talk about it like a machine most of the time. But when you’re tired, you talk about it like a person with moods."

He stared into his tea.

"I hear…patterns," he said. "Hum changes, power redistributions. The way the vents shift on certain cycles." He rolled his shoulders, as if to shake off the memory of the maintenance corridor flicker. "Sometimes it’s just noise. Sometimes it feels like…"

He groped for a word that didn’t sound like a confession.

"Like it’s breathing," he settled on. "Louder or quieter depending on where you stand."

"Hmm," Sera said.

"You don’t?" he asked.

"I hear it," she said. "It’s just…background. Like wind in a garden dome. I notice when something’s wrong in my sectors, sure. A pump whine, a bad valve. But most of the time it’s just there so the silence doesn’t feel like the void."

He watched her hand as she wrapped it around her cup. Small calluses from trellis ties, a faint scar along one knuckle from a tool slip. She moved like someone who trusted the floor to stay where it was.

"When it's quiet," he said, "I start waiting for the crack."

"Even in here?" she asked. "In the greens?"

"Especially in corridors," he said. "Less so in your jungle." He tried to make it a joke. "The plants are too loud."

"Rude," she said. "They work very hard at respiration."

He huffed a breath that was almost a laugh.

"You know Ruth used to pray for the hull," he said, surprising himself. "Hand on the wall. Like it was a person who could be tired."

"She told me once," Sera said. "When I ran into her near the chapel. She said she asked God to hold the hands that hold the Ship." She nudged his shoulder lightly with hers. "You realize that includes you, right?"

"Feels presumptuous," he said. "Putting myself in the same sentence as the hull."

"You’re the one who hears it breathing," she said. "Seems fair."

They watched a group of younger volunteers file past, laughing too loudly, their uniforms still damp from the last mist cycle. One of them tripped over the seam in the floor near the sector door. Sera winced in sympathetic pain even as she smiled.

"First week," she said. "He’ll learn."

"Or the Ship will relocate the seam just to mess with him," Jonah said.

"Now who’s giving it moods?" she asked.

He let the teasing sit. It was easier than saying: my mother talked to the walls when she was coming apart, and I don’t know how much of that I’ve inherited.

"For what it's worth," Sera said, after a quiet stretch, "I don’t mind that you listen. To the Ship. To people."

He glanced at her. "Some people find it unnerving."

"Some people don’t like knowing anyone is paying that much attention," she said. "But out there"—she jerked her chin toward the unseen hull—"I’d rather have the man who hears the difference between a tired pump and a dying one. In here, I’d rather have the friend who notices when I’ve had three bad shifts in a row."

Friend. The word landed somewhere behind his ribs and made a small, unsteady space.

"You say that now," he said. "Wait until I start sending you annotated logs of your sleep cycles."

"If you ever get my sleep data without my consent," she said, "I will make you repot every single citrus tree in B-ring with your bare hands."

He smiled, small but real.

"Fair consequences," he said.

The lift down the corridor chimed, doors whooshing open. A cluster of workers stepped out, another cluster got in. The flow of bodies shifted.

"You on next shift already?" he asked.

"No," she said. "I should go home. Pretend I sleep." She rose, then hesitated, hand hovering near his shoulder as if to steady herself on a ship that wasn't actually moving differently. "You?"

"Back toward the spine," he said. "Reports. More screens." He lifted his cup. "And tea that tastes like it’s been sitting under a status light for an hour."

"Shipboard delicacy," she said.

For a second, neither of them moved.

"You know the sound you make when you’re not talking?" she said.

He blinked. "I make a sound when I’m not talking?"

"Hmm," she said. "More like—" She mimicked, gently: a quiet exhale through her nose, the kind of almost-sigh that sat between vigilance and rest. "You’ve been making that less out here."

"Less?" he asked.

"Yeah," she said. "In the gardens you hum sometimes instead. I like that one better."

He felt heat rise to his face, absurdly.

"I do not hum," he said.

"You absolutely do," she said. "We’ll gather evidence." She tapped the rim of his cup lightly. "Come back next shift. The peppers miss you."

"Pretty sure they don’t," he said.

"I do," she said, and then, before he could decide what to do with that, she stepped away into the moving corridor, letting the crowd carry her toward the lifts.

The bench felt different without her there, empty in a way that had nothing to do with mass.

Jonah looked up once more at the status strips. Moisture, flow, all in the green. Behind them, deeper in the metal, he could hear the lower, steadier hum of the Ship doing its endless work.

He listened for a few breaths, then let his shoulders drop by a millimeter.

"Hold the hands that hold the Ship," he heard Ruth say in memory.

For the first time, he allowed that maybe those hands included his, and maybe, improbably, Sera’s too.

He finished his tea, such as it was, and rose to join the flow, carrying the echo of her I do with him toward the next bank of screens.
