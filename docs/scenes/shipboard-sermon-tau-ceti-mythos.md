# Scene: Shipboard Sermon on Tau Ceti

The worship hall was narrow, the ceiling too low for the number of bodies pressed inside. Condensation beaded along the ribs of the metal overhead, catching the warm light of the wall panels and turning it soft and hazy. Someone had draped cloth over the vents to make them look less like vents and more like something holy.

Jonah sat between his father and an aisle, shoulders drawn in, hands folded around the edge of the bench. The air smelled like recycled incense—manufactured resin pellets, not anything from a real tree—and damp work clothes. When people sang, their voices tangled with the faint hum of the maglev somewhere beyond the bulkhead.

"We remember," the preacher said, palm resting against the thin tablet that held their scriptures and archive excerpts. "We remember the world that was given and the world that was lost. We remember Earth—not because we will return, but because we were sent." 

The congregation murmured the response. Jonah felt his father's chest move beside him as Samuel spoke the words: "We are sent. We are carried."

On the far wall, above the improvised altar, someone had painted a circle of pale gold on dark blue. A simple ring, no continents, no clouds. Just a star.

"Project Exodus was not a mistake," the preacher went on. "It was not panic. It was calling. Long before any of us were born, our mothers' mothers' mothers agreed to step into the dark, to bind their children and their children's children to a promise. Not to reach back for what was burning, but to go forward to what waited ahead, even knowing they would never see it with their own eyes."

A verse slid onto the wall from the projector—old text about sojourners and a better country. The letters floated over the painted circle, scripture layered over star.

"The planners called it Tau Ceti," she said. "A name like a number. An entry on a chart. A G-type star twelve light-years from the world we lost. They measured its light. They counted its dust and hinted planets. They said: here, maybe, our children's children will stand on ground that is not steel." She looked up from the tablet, eyes moving over the crowd. "But we know it as more than a coordinate."

Jonah stared at the ring of paint. He had seen star maps in school—flat diagrams, clean lines—but none of them had felt like this, like something that watched you back.

"We know Tau Ceti," the preacher said, "as the far shore of obedience. The name we give to the place where this long faithfulness might end. We do not know what waits there. We are not promised a second Eden. We are not promised safety. We are promised only this: that God is not less present there than here." 

Samuel's hand rested, briefly, on Jonah's knee. A small weight, then gone.

Around them, people shifted, some nodding, some staring at the floor. An older woman in the front row mouthed "Tau Ceti" silently, like an extra line to an old prayer.

"Children," the preacher said, and her voice gentled. "You did not choose this journey. You did not choose steel instead of soil, rivers that run in channels overhead instead of along the ground. You did not choose to be born halfway between a world destroyed and a star you will never, in your own lifetime, see." A few scattered laughs answered that, tired and affectionate. "But you are not accidents. You are links in a chain." 

Her hand lifted toward the painted circle.

"When you hear the old ones say 'for the sake of Tau Ceti,' remember: they are not asking you to love a star. They are asking you to love the ones who will come after you. To hold the line so that, if the ship arrives and a door opens and real air hits real skin, someone will be there to feel it."

Jonah's mind tried to picture it—sky that did not curve back over you, ground that did not hum faintly with machinery. He felt nothing at first, just a blank, like when a Companion asked him a question he didn't understand. Then, slowly, the idea of "after" uncoiled, long and thin, like one of the transit rails stretching into haze.

After the sermon, as people queued for thin cups of synth-coffee and conversations turned to shift schedules and sick relatives, Jonah stood close to his father.

"Do you think we'll make it?" he asked, voice low enough that the words barely left his throat.

Samuel considered. He did that—actually thought before he answered, as if words were tools that could break if handled wrong.

"I think," he said at last, "that whether we see it or not, what we do matters all the way there." He nodded toward the painted circle. "Tau Ceti is just what we call the far end of faithfulness."

Jonah looked up at the gold ring one more time. The star had no features, no flares or spots, just a circle of paint on metal, already scuffed at the edges by time and damp.

He didn't know if he believed in it. But he knew he couldn't stop thinking about the distance.
