---

The mediation room tried very hard not to look like trouble.

Someone had painted the walls a soft blue instead of the usual ship gray. There was a strip of fake grass along one side—a narrow, carefully contained patch of green under a grow panel—and a low shelf with a few worn toys: stacking rings, a puzzle board missing one animal, a soft cube with numbers stitched on each face. The air smelled faintly of cleaner and something sweet Jonah couldn't name.

He sat in a chair sized for kids his age, feet flat for once instead of dangling. Two other boys sat to his left and right, identical gray school tunics rumpled from the scuffle that had brought them here. One had a reddening mark on his wrist; the other kept rubbing his elbow as if expecting it to start hurting.

Across from them, on the far wall, a Companion node sat in a recessed niche above a small table. Its light ring was dim, a soft, steady glow.

"This isn't a punishment," the proctor had said. "It's just a chance to talk about what happened."

"Right," Jonah had answered, even though his stomach had already started to knot the way it did during emergency drills.

Now the proctor—a woman with tired eyes and a badge that read E. KATO—sat on the edge of the fake grass strip, hands folded loosely. She smiled in a way that tried not to be a performance.

"Okay," she said. "We're almost done with school for today. Let's just take a few minutes together and see if we can understand each other a little better."

Jonah focused on the seam where the wall panel met the floor. If he kept his eyes on something solid, the room might stay the size it was.

"Companion," Kato said. "Please start the log."

The node chimed, a small, ascending tone.

"Behavioral Stability Mediation," it said. The voice was neutral, a little higher than the one in Jonah's apartment. "Date: cycle one-nine-four-seven, ring C. Participants: student Jonah Hale, student Rafi Yen, student Tomas Kwe. Facilitator: Instructor E. Kato. Recording begins."

Stability. The word made Jonah think of hull plates and grav rings, not boys in a hallway.

"Hi," Kato said, looking at each of them in turn. "I'm Instructor Kato. Thank you for coming in with me instead of going straight home. I know that's not fun."

Tomas shrugged, eyes on his shoes. Rafi scowled in the direction of the door.

"Let's start simple," Kato went on. "Who wants to tell me what happened by the south viewport this morning?"

"He pushed me," Rafi said immediately, jabbing a thumb toward Jonah. "For no reason."

"That's not true," Jonah said. His voice came out tighter than he meant. "You were leaning over the rail."

"Everyone leans," Rafi shot back. "It's just a viewport."

Jonah's heart sped up. "It's above a drop," he said. "If you slip—"

"There's a second rail," Rafi interrupted. "And a net. I'm not a baby."

Kato raised a hand. "One at a time," she said. "Rafi, thank you. Jonah, we'll come back to you. Tomas? What did you see?"

Tomas shifted. "Rafi was doing the thing," he muttered.

"What thing?" Kato asked.

"Leaning," Tomas said. "Like he said. Right over the top rail."

"I wasn't over it," Rafi protested. "I had my feet back."

"You were laughing," Tomas added, ignoring him. "And going like—" He mimed tipping forward, arms out. "Like in vids."

Jonah's hands clenched on his knees.

"And then?" Kato prompted.

"Then Jonah grabbed him," Tomas said. "From behind."

"Pushed," Rafi corrected.

"Pulled," Tomas said stubbornly. "He yanked you back. You fell."

"He threw me," Rafi insisted. "On purpose."

Kato let them talk it out for a moment, then cut in gently.

"Okay," she said. "Different words, same event. Rafi ended up on the floor. Jonah, tell me what you remember." 

He swallowed. The viewport scene replayed in his head in perfect detail: the arc of Rafi's body over the rail, the gap below, the memory of his father's boots on the very real skin of the hull far, far beneath places like that.

"He was leaning," Jonah said. "Too far. His weight was over the guard. If something shook or—" He stopped himself before he said if the hull gave.

"There are safeties," Rafi muttered.

"What did you think would happen?" Kato asked Jonah.

"I thought he was going to fall," Jonah said. His fingers dug into the fabric of his pants. "Down. All the way."

"That's impossible," Rafi said. He laughed, but it came out thin. "There's a net."

"I didn't know how far," Jonah said. "Or if the net was checked. Or if he’d hit the rail wrong. It only takes one—" He bit the rest off.

Kato's expression stayed neutral, but something in it softened.

"So you grabbed him," she said.

"Yes."

"Why did you grab him the way you did?"

He hadn't meant to. That was the worst part. He had just moved—hand catching the back of Rafi's tunic, yanking hard enough that the other boy's feet had left the ground. There had been a second where both of them were off balance; Jonah remembered the sick tilt in his own stomach as much as Rafi's shout.

"I didn't think," Jonah said. "I just—" He mimed the motion, quick and ugly. "Pulled."

"Did you want him to get hurt?" Kato asked.

"No," Jonah said, too fast. "I was trying to stop him from—" The word falling jammed in his throat. "If something happened to him and I didn't do anything, it would be my fault."

The Companion's light ring brightened a fraction, a note in its buffer.

"Observation," it said quietly. "Subject expresses heightened sense of personal responsibility for others' safety."

Kato shot it a look. "Log it, don't interrupt," she said.

"Apologies," the AI replied. Its tone did not change.

She turned back to the boys. "Rafi," she said. "How did it feel when Jonah pulled you?"

"It hurt," he said. "And it was embarrassing. Everyone looked."

"Did you feel scared?" she asked.

He hesitated. "For a second," he admitted. "When my feet came up."

"Thank you," she said. "Tomas?"

"I thought he was gonna go over," Tomas said quietly. "For real."

Kato nodded. "So," she said, "it sounds like there were a lot of feelings at once. Rafi felt embarrassed and a little scared. Tomas felt scared. Jonah felt...what?" She glanced at him.

"Scared," he said. The word felt too small. "If he fell it would be because I didn't stop it."

"Or," Rafi muttered, "because you pushed me."

"Enough," Kato said, not unkindly. "We're not here to decide who's bad. We're here to decide how to keep everyone safe next time."

The word bad still stuck to Jonah's ribs.

"Companion," Kato said. "Please record individual follow-ups. Group section ends."

"Acknowledged," the node said. "Group portion concluded. Behavioral Stability Log updated."

She sent Rafi and Tomas out first, promising they'd only be a minute and then could go back to class. The door hissed closed behind them, leaving Jonah alone with Kato and the AI.

The room seemed bigger with fewer bodies, and somehow emptier at the same time.

"Jonah," Kato said. "I'm not angry with you."

His throat tightened. "The log is," he said.

A small smile tugged at her mouth. "The log doesn't get angry. It gets full. There's a difference."

He didn't see it.

"I need to ask you a few questions just for you," she went on. "Is that okay?"

It wasn't, but saying no felt like a different kind of trouble.

"Okay," he said.

She glanced up at the node. "Companion?"

"Individual segment," it said. "Subject: Jonah Hale."

Kato rested her elbows on her knees, bringing her face closer to his level. "Have you been sleeping okay lately?" she asked.

He thought about the nights he'd lain awake counting the tiny creaks in the walls, listening for the thread of his mother's breathing in the next room.

"Sometimes," he said.

"Sometimes yes or sometimes no?" she asked gently.

"Sometimes it's hard," he said. "If there was a drill that day. Or if the lights flicker. Or if Mom—" He cut himself off.

Kato didn't pounce on the unfinished word. "If Mom what?" she asked, voice as neutral as the AI's.

He stared at his hands. "If she's…quiet." The memory of the kitchen table pressed in on him. "I listen to make sure she's breathing. Then I can't stop listening."

The Companion's light flared slightly.

"Observation," it said. "Subject reports hypervigilance in response to parental withdrawal."

"Log it," Kato repeated. "Don't perform it."

"Logged," the AI said.

She shifted her attention fully back to Jonah. "Do you feel like you have to watch other people all the time?" she asked. "Make sure they're safe?"

"If I don't, something bad will happen," he said. The words surprised him by how quickly they came.

"And it would be your fault," she prompted.

He nodded, once.

"Even if you didn't cause it?" she asked.

He nodded again.

"Do you ever feel like your feelings are…too big?" she asked. "Like they might hurt people if they get out?"

He thought of the way his hands had moved without asking him in the hallway. The way his voice sometimes came out too loud when he was scared.

"Yes," he whispered.

"Do you tell anyone when you feel that way?" she asked.

"My dad," he said. "Sometimes."

"What does he say?"

"That it's okay to be scared," Jonah said. "That fear doesn't make me bad."

Kato's eyes went softer around the edges. "He's right," she said.

"But the log—" he started.

"The log isn't about good or bad," she said. "It's about patterns. So that if something hurts you, or starts to, the Ship can see it and send help."

He stared at the glowing ring above the table. It looked like an eye that never blinked.

"Is it looking at me now?" he asked.

"It's listening," she said. "Like I am."

"Will it remember?" he asked.

"Yes," the AI answered before she could. "This record will be preserved as part of your Behavioral Stability Log."

There was a small, almost inaudible chime as it said it. Jonah felt something inside him click in response.

"Who sees it?" he asked.

"Your instructors," Kato said. "Certain clinicians. The system that helps assign training later on. They use it to understand how best to support you." She hesitated. "And to make sure no one ends up carrying more than they can handle alone."

He thought of his mother, alone at the table. "What if they decide I'm carrying too much?" he asked.

Kato did not answer right away. Her gaze flicked, just once, toward the node.

"Then," she said slowly, "we find ways to lighten the load."

The Companion added, "Flag: subject Jonah Hale marked for periodic follow-up. Risk index: elevated sensitivity, elevated self-blame, no current indicators of active instability. Recommendation: monitor."

Monitor.

The word lodged under his sternum. It tasted like the pause before an alarm.

"Thank you, Jonah," Kato said. "You did well. You can go back to class now."

He stood on legs that felt a little unsteady. At the door, he hesitated.

"Is there a number?" he asked without knowing he was going to.

"A number?" she repeated.

"On…me," he said. "In the log. Like how likely I am to…" He couldn't finish the sentence.

Kato's mouth opened, then closed. "Numbers are just tools," she said carefully. "They don't get to decide who you are."

"Do I have one?" he pressed.

The Companion spoke.

"Current composite stability index: four point three on a ten-scale, with adjustment factors for environment and family context," it said.

Four point three. The specificity of it made his skin crawl.

"That is not a sentence," Kato said sharply. "It's an internal marker."

"Internal," Jonah echoed.

"It helps us notice if something changes," she said. "That's all."

He nodded, though nothing inside him agreed.

In the corridor outside, the noise of regular school life washed over him: footsteps, laughter, the distant call of an instructor. It all sounded thinner than before.

As he walked back toward his band, Jonah became aware of the Companion nodes tucked into the ceilings at intervals, their rings dim, their lenses small and dark.

He had always known they were there. Today, for the first time, he understood that somewhere behind them, a version of him now existed as a line on a graph, a number on a scale, a file that would grow without his help.

If he broke, the Ship would be able to say it had seen it coming.

If he didn't, it would be able to say it had watched.
