---

The apartment was too quiet.

Quiet in a way that didn’t feel like peace, or rest, or privacy. Quiet like a room waiting for something to happen. Quiet that made Jonah slow his steps without knowing why.

He rounded the corner into the kitchen.

His mother sat at the table. Not doing anything. Not drinking tea, not reading, not talking to anyone. Her hands lay flat on the surface, palms down, fingers slightly spread, as if she’d placed them there and then forgotten why.

Her eyes were open. That was the worst part.  
If her eyes were closed, she’d be asleep.  
If she were asleep, everything would be fine.

“Mom?” he asked.

Nothing changed.

Not her face. Not her breath. Not the angle of her body. She didn’t look at him. She didn’t look at anything. She wasn’t gone. She just wasn’t…here.

He stood there, waiting for the usual signs.  
A cough. A blink. A “sorry, honey, I’m just tired.”

Nothing.

A tiny pressure began behind his ribs. The kind that made it hard to breathe. He didn’t know what to call it. He didn’t know it was fear. Not yet.

He took a small step closer.

“Mom?”

Her jaw twitched once, like a brief misfire, and then went still. Her eyes stayed fixed on the far wall. Jonah followed her gaze but saw nothing there—just a patch of gray paneling, scuffed near the bottom where a chair had scraped it years ago.

He waited for her to move.

He waited long enough that his legs started to ache.

He didn’t know what was wrong. He didn’t know why she couldn’t get up. He didn’t know why she looked like she’d been dropped into the room from far away and hadn’t landed properly.

He only knew one thing, and it came from somewhere deep and ancient inside him:

**If he got too close, something terrible would happen.**

Not to her.  
To him.

That thought didn’t make sense, but it wrapped itself around his spine and locked him in place.

He wanted to help.  
He wanted to shake her shoulder, or get water, or call his father’s name, or do whatever kids in stories did when their parents looked wrong.

But his feet wouldn’t move.

He stood there with his hands clenched, nails pressing crescents into his skin. His breath came shallow, like the air near her had gotten thinner.

“Mom…” His voice broke. He hated that.

Still nothing.

Her chest rose and fell, slowly, mechanically, as if the rest of her wasn’t connected to the breathing part anymore.

He felt something cold crawl up the back of his neck.  
A sense that he was witnessing something he wasn’t supposed to see. Something private. Something dangerous. A crack in the world.

He took one step back.

Then another.

His mother didn’t react. Not even a flicker.

He turned and walked down the hallway.  
Not fast.  
Not running.  
Just getting away. Like his body knew how far was safe even if his mind didn’t.

He stopped in his bedroom doorway and pressed his back against the frame.

He waited again.  
He told himself she would call his name any second.  
She always did.

But the apartment stayed silent.

He stayed there until he heard the outer door slide open—Samuel’s boots on the metal floor, the soft thud of him setting down his tool bag, the quiet, tired sigh of a man expecting to step back into normal life.

Jonah didn’t move.

He heard his father pause when he saw the kitchen.  
He heard a sharp inhale—Samuel noticing what Jonah had seen.  
He didn’t hear words. His father didn’t speak right away.

Jonah closed his eyes.

He didn’t go back into the kitchen.  
He didn’t check on her.  
He didn’t answer when Samuel called his name, voice tight and worried.

He stayed exactly where he was, breathing shallow, heart beating too fast, trying to convince himself he hadn’t done anything wrong.

He was only seven.

He didn’t know that walking away would carve a line in his life he’d feel forever.

He didn’t know that this moment—the freeze, the fear, the retreat—would return in dreams and memories and choices he couldn’t explain.

He didn’t know he would carry it like a quiet bruise under his ribs for decades.

He only knew his mother had been hurting, and he had walked away.

And no matter how small he was, or how frozen, or how scared, the guilt of that simple truth curled itself around his heart and never let go.
