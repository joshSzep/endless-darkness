# Daily Life

## Overview
Life on the ship is structured, crowded, and predictable. People live in small quarters, work long shifts, and rely heavily on community.

## Housing
- Compact living pods
- Shared kitchens and communal spaces
- Multi-family residential blocks

## Work Life
- Three-shift schedules around the clock
- High value on technical and maintenance roles
- Early vocational assignment during adolescence

## Education
- AI tutors for academics
- Human mentors for ethics and culture
- Localized school hubs in each sector

## Food
- Mixed hydroponic and soil-grown crops
- Algae and protein cultures
- Limited livestock
- Occasional luxury imports from controlled bio labs

## Social Rituals
- Faith gatherings
- Work group celebrations
- Seasonal festivals tied to ship events
- Commemorations of the launch

## Living with the Void
- The constant hum of systems and circulation replaces natural silence; most people do not notice it until it stops or changes, at which point fear rises fast.
- Children learn early that outside the hull there is nothing they can survive in; nursery rhymes, safety drills, and classroom stories fold this fact into routine.
- Observation ports and exterior camera feeds are regulated and rare in everyday life. For many citizens the true darkness of space is something glimpsed a handful of times, remembered with a mix of awe and nausea.
- People develop small superstitions around power flickers, pressure checks, and hull maintenance announcements: tapping bulkheads, pausing conversations, or muttering phrases that acknowledge the ship and ask it to “hold.”

## Relevance to Jonah
He grows up in an environment shaped by routine, scarcity, and quiet pressure to not make trouble.
