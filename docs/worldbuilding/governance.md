# Governance

## Overview
The ship is governed by a hybrid system: human councils for local policy and a shipwide AI responsible for mission safety. The AI does not rule, but it has absolute authority in emergencies.

## Human Institutions
- Sector Councils: Handle local disputes and resource allocation
- Central Assembly: Representatives from major sectors
- Committees: Education, health, engineering, agriculture

## AI Role
- Monitors all critical systems
- Prevents actions that threaten mission integrity
- Predicts and manages large scale risks
- Provides psychological stabilization protocols when needed

## Laws and Order
- Human courts exist for non-mission-critical offenses
- AI interventions occur only in cases of imminent danger
- Population control enforced lightly but steadily

## Political Tension
- Some view the AI as necessary
- Some see it as a tolerated overseer
- Religious groups vary in acceptance
- Labor sectors feel under-represented

## Relevance to Jonah
Jonah’s breakdown later in the novel intersects with governance, creating stakes when his instability triggers AI involvement.
