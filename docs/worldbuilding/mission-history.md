# Mission History

## Overview
The ship launched because Earth faced extinction from a rogue ice giant. The launch was the largest project in human history. Over roughly 2,000 years of preparation, thousands of generation ships were built and launched as part of a mission conceived to last about 40,000 years from departure to arrival. The ship itself has been in motion for roughly 20,000 years—half that span—and most communication with Earth or other ships ended deep in the distant past.

## Event Zero
Astronomers detected a rogue ice giant on a collision course with Earth, with impact predicted roughly 2,000 years after discovery. Impact was expected to wipe out all life. There was no way to stop it.

## Project Exodus
- Construction of thousands of generation ships
- Recruitment of global populations
- Preservation of genetic diversity
- AI systems built to manage missions lasting thousands of years
- Religious and cultural groups given space aboard various ships

## The Launch
The ship left Earth roughly 20,000 years before Jonah’s lifetime, at the midpoint of the planned 40,000-year mission. Last known contact with other ships or Earth was many millennia in the past.

## Current Belief Onboard
For Jonah’s time:
- Earth is mythical
- The launch is semi-historical, semi-sacred
- Records are partial and degraded
- The mission is still the backbone of ship identity

## Relevance to Jonah
He views Earth more as a metaphor than a place. The idea of home becomes symbolic for him. A mirror of his own internal journey.
