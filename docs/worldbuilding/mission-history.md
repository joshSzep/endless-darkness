# Mission History

## Overview
The ship launched because Earth faced extinction from a rogue ice giant. The launch was the largest project in human history. Over roughly 2,000 years of preparation, thousands of generation ships were built and launched as part of a mission conceived to last about 40,000 years from departure to arrival, aimed toward **Tau Ceti**, a nearby Sun-like star about 12 light-years from Earth.

The specific choice of Tau Ceti was framed, in the language of the planners, as "the most statistically reachable promise of another Earth" rather than a guarantee. Its relative proximity, Sun-adjacent spectral type, and early candidate signals of rocky worlds in the habitable zone made it the centerpiece of Project Exodus mythos: not a promised land, but the least-worst shot humanity had.

## Event Zero
Astronomers detected a rogue ice giant on a collision course with Earth, with impact predicted roughly 2,000 years after discovery. Impact was expected to wipe out all life. There was no way to stop it.

## Project Exodus
- Construction of thousands of generation ships
- Recruitment of global populations
- Preservation of genetic diversity
- AI systems built to manage missions lasting thousands of years
- Religious and cultural groups given space aboard various ships

## The Launch
The ship left Earth roughly 20,000 years before Jonah’s lifetime, at the midpoint of the planned 40,000-year mission, beginning a slow, sub-relativistic crossing toward Tau Ceti. Last known contact with other ships or Earth was many millennia in the past.

## Current Belief Onboard
For Jonah’s time:
- Earth is mythical; **no living person has ever seen it** except through archives, simulations, or inherited stories
- The launch is semi-historical, semi-sacred
- Records are partial and degraded
- The mission is still the backbone of ship identity
- "Tau Ceti" is as much a prayer or proverb as a coordinate as it is a destination; few onboard could explain the original astronomy, but the name survives in liturgy, slang, and half-remembered lessons
- **No one alive will ever see Tau Ceti** outside of filtered sensor data and cached images; arrival, if it happens, is always for "children’s children" beyond any present lifetime

## Relevance to Jonah
He views Earth more as a metaphor than a place. The idea of home becomes symbolic for him. A mirror of his own internal journey.
