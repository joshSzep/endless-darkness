# Religion

## Overview
The ship preserved the old religions of Earth, and new beliefs formed during the journey across roughly 20,000 years of travel within a 40,000-year mission. Faith shapes identity, community, and conflict.

## Surviving Earth Religions
- Christianity (dominant variations spread across sectors)
- Islam
- Buddhism
- Hinduism
- Judaism
- Other traditional practices

## Ship-Born Belief Systems
- Continuity Faith: Mission as sacred duty
- AI Reverence: Belief that the AI is chosen by God or destiny
- Earth Longing Cults: Idealized memory of the lost planet
- Techno-Animism: Spiritual presence in machines

## Lydia’s Family
Peter and Helen Marlow practice a warm but strict evangelical Christianity. Beloved by many, feared by their daughter.

## Samuel’s Family
Old-style Christianity rooted in quiet faith, forgiveness, and resilience. Ruth Hale embodies this fully.

## Tensions
- Evangelicals vs Continuity groups
- AI-friendly faiths vs AI-hostile ones
- Conflicts over mental health, destiny, and morality

## Relevance to Jonah
He inherits conflicting religious expectations. His mother rejected her faith. His father held onto his. Jonah grows up caught between them.
