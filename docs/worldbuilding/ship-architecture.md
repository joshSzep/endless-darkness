# Ship Architecture

## Overview
The ship is a rotating multi-ring vessel built for a mission spanning tens of millennia. It is hundreds of kilometers long and dozens of kilometers in diameter. Its principal living volume is an internally rotating cylinder: a continuous, ribbon-like continent of soil, water, towns, and fields curving out of sight overhead.

From the ground, citizens perceive a "sky" that is actually the far inner wall of the cylinder, studded with mirror arrays and light panels simulating circadian patterns. To a child, it feels less like a ship and more like a man-made world.

It contains habitats, agricultural cylinders, industrial zones, archives, and structural hull corridors. It operates as a self-contained planet.

## Major Sections
- Habitat Cylinder and Rings: Residential and commercial districts arranged in long bands analogous to continents and regions on old Earth
- Agricultural Cylinders: Food production and livestock in parallel, more utilitarian cylinders
- Industrial Spine: Manufacturing, reactor systems, and repair bays running the ship’s length
- Hull Corridors: Outer maintenance zones where Samuel works, stretching for hundreds of kilometers
- Memory Vaults: Archives and mission history in hardened, isolated modules
- Core AI Node: Central processing cluster, physically protected, massively redundant, and isolated from direct human access

### Habitat Cylinder and Bands
- Segmented into urban strips, quieter residential bands, forested parks, and chains of lakes and reservoirs
- Each band can be environmentally tuned (day length, humidity, vegetation profile) while still sharing a connected horizon
- Looking along the length of the cylinder, towns and forests shrink into a bluish haze before the curvature swallows them

### Agricultural Cylinders
- Narrower, more utilitarian cylinders with regular fields, orchards, and hydroponic racks
- Minimal “sky dressing”; light optimized for yield rather than aesthetics
- Access tightly controlled; most citizens only see them via education feeds or work assignments

### Industrial Spine
- Multi-kilometer corridor of low or zero-g infrastructure embedded along the central axis
- Hosts fusion reactors, reaction-mass tanks, propulsion systems, and fabrication arrays
- Also houses regional processing nodes for the AI and key communication trunks

### Hull Corridors
- Narrow, claustrophobic passageways just beneath the outer hull
- Lined with mag tracks, anchor points, and service interfaces for drones and human workers
- Only a tiny fraction is personally known by any one maintenance crew; the full labyrinth is mapped and remembered by the AI

### Memory Vaults
- Heavily shielded repositories of historical records, art, science, and cultural memory
- Distributed in multiple redundant sites to survive localized catastrophes

### Core AI Node
- Located near the structural center of the ship, outside the main gravity rings
- Surrounded by multiple armor and radiation layers, with no direct physical access from civilian spaces
- Interacts with the rest of the ship only via hardened data channels and telepresence drones

## Gravity
Artificial gravity is produced through rotation of the main habitat cylinder and auxiliary rings. Nominal surface gravity on the main habitat is calibrated close to Earth-normal, but slight variations exist between sectors due to rotation adjustments and structural tolerances.

Core areas near the spine have lower or zero gravity. Workers moving between the spine, hull corridors, and habitat bands must continually adapt to different load and balance sensations.

## Transit
- High-speed maglev rail lines run along the length of the habitat cylinder, linking major cities and sectors over hundreds of kilometers
- Local trams, lifts, and walkways crisscross each band; most citizens rarely travel more than a few kilometers from where they were born
- Cargo lifts and tunnels connect habitats, agricultural cylinders, and industrial sections
- EV suits and mag tracks in the hull corridors support exterior and sub-hull work in variable or zero-g
- Maintenance and logistics corridors form a hidden second geography beneath the public one—a tangle of tunnels and shafts that only workers, drones, and the AI fully comprehend

## Environmental Controls
- Atmospheric recycling with multiple redundant scrubber farms
- Water reclamation, purification, and redistribution, including open bodies of water and hidden reservoirs
- Temperature and humidity regulation tuned differently by sector
- Radiation shielding via hull layers, water tanks, and active field management in some zones

## Sense of Scale and Weaknesses
To inhabitants, the ship feels both vast and finite. Standing in a central plaza, a person can look along the length of the cylinder and see towns fading into haze, the curvature slowly swallowing them. Looking "up," they see another strip of land inverted above them, its rivers secured in channels, its night lights dimmer with distance.

Despite its robustness, the ship has weaknesses:
- Vulnerable or aging hull plates
- Reactor and spine maintenance intervals that cannot be indefinitely postponed
- Psychological strain of confinement and the knowledge that there is nowhere else to go
- Dependence on the AI for high-level coordination and risk modeling
