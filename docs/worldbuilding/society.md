# Society

## Overview
The ship houses roughly two million people. It functions as a closed ecosystem with its own norms, pressures, and cultural drift, accumulated over nearly 20,000 years of continuous travel within a planned 40,000-year mission. Life aboard is shaped by scarcity, confinement, and the knowledge that failure means extinction. Society is stable, but psychological tension sits right under the surface.

## Population Structure
- Multi-generational families
- Strong neighborhood identity by sector
- Low geographic mobility
- Informal class strata based on labor value and education
- Cultural drift over centuries

## Cultural Values
- Stability and cooperation
- Respect for technical labor
- Quiet distrust of extremism
- High value on emotional self-control
- A moral expectation to not endanger the mission

## Social Pressures
- Everyone is monitored for mental health
- Births are regulated but not fully controlled
- Privacy is limited
- Careers are influenced by aptitude testing
- Community reputation matters

## Background Fear
- From childhood, citizens understand that there is no outside world to fall back on; the ship is the only ground they will ever know.
- Emergency drills, loss-of-pressure warnings, and stories of past near-failures keep a low-grade awareness of catastrophe alive, even when systems are stable.
- People are encouraged to be calm and grateful, but private conversations often circle back to "what if" scenarios about hull breaches, system failures, or the end of the mission.

## Fault Lines
- Class differences between technical sectors and labor sectors
- Tension between religious communities
- Distrust of the AI among some groups
- Generational divides between older and younger inhabitants

## Everyday AI Presence
- Nearly every household has at least one dedicated Companion interface: wall projectors, audio nodes, or shared terminals.
- Schools and training centers are co-taught by human instructors and Companion AIs; lesson plans are dynamically personalized within strict mission-focused curricula.
- Workplaces, clinics, transit systems, and public squares all host Companion access points, making guidance and oversight feel as ubiquitous as air or gravity.
- Some professions and high-risk sectors permit more intimate forms of connection (ear-pieces, AR lenses, occasionally medical neural links), though these are regulated and often controversial.

## Mission Over Individual
- From childhood, citizens learn that they are part of a chain stretching thousands of years; they are stewards of a fragile continuity, not free agents in an open world.
- The AI quietly reinforces a recurring idea in many forms: the mission must outlast any one life, family, or generation.
- People know, at least intellectually, that if a choice must be made between a group and the long-term viability of the ship, the mission wins. This knowledge sits like background radiation beneath daily routines and private hopes.

## Trust, Resentment, and Faith
- Most people accept Companion AIs as necessary and even comforting, especially in crises; they are the first responders in emotional, medical, and technical emergencies.
- Others experience the seamless AI network as a soft cage: there are no truly secret corners, no breakdowns that go entirely unseen, no rebellions without some kind of record.
- Religious communities differ in their posture: some see the AI as a powerful tool entrusted to humanity by God, while others treat it cautiously, limiting use in private spaces and resisting neural or intimate interfaces.
- These differences create subtle cultural markers—how often a household speaks aloud to a Companion, whether prayers mention the ship’s systems, whether children are encouraged to treat the AI as a friend, a machine, or something in between.

## Relevance to Jonah
Jonah grows up in a working-sector community shaped by steady labor, small pleasures, and silent emotional endurance. His shyness and internal storms form early in this environment.
