# Technology

## Overview
Technology is advanced but utilitarian. Everything exists to ensure survival over roughly 40,000 years of deep space mission time, including about 20,000 years of deep space travel. Systems must be repairable, modular, and durable.

## Core Systems
- AI network for long term strategy
- Fusion reactors
- Hydroponic and soil-based agriculture
- Closed loop life support
- Recycling and reclamation infrastructure
- Advanced materials for hull integrity

## Everyday Tech
- AI companions for education
- Neuro-stabilizers for mental health episodes
- Wearable monitors
- Smart textiles and adaptive clothing
- Localized holographic interfaces

## Limitations
- No faster-than-light travel
- Communication beyond local space is impossible
- Hardware decays faster than knowledge can be preserved
- Medicine is advanced but resource constrained

## Relevance to Jonah
He treats technology as a given, not a marvel. The AI becomes central to both his suffering and his healing.
